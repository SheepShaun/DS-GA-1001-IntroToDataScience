aS'Unsympathetic protagonist and way too much profanity for my taste.  I purchased the Audible version.  I\'m not opposed to profanity for effect, but from the first line he drops the f-bomb, then in the chapter about recycling human waste, he uses the word "sh*t" every other sentence and the word "a-hole."  I found it unnecessary to repeatedly refer to his waste as sh*t. Then the next few chapters sounded like a botany lecture by a foul-mouthed professor. I lost interest and returned the book.  I was planning to see the movie, but just changed my mind after listening to the first hour of the book. Zzzzzzzz.Update 10-12-15:  Saw the movie today with my son, and it was quite good. The Mark Watney in the movie was a likable character.  Perhaps it was the narrator of the Audible book that I disliked.'

aS'Great read,  everyone in my family read it and enjoyed it.'

aS'It definitely calls for a hard core SciFi fan, as it gets very technical at times, but still tells a good story with interesting character(s)  situations.'
p602
aS"Enjoyed this book.  A great idea and story line.  I do think the writer gets far to technical and so much of the science I just don't understand.  I don't know how one would write this book without all this science, but, at times, it was hard to digest.  It didn't stop me from really enjoying the concept."

aS"Remember the movie Robinson Crusoe on Mars? Well, if you do, get thee to a hypnotist and have any trace of it removed from your memory. Aside from the apparent similarities that both include stranded astronauts and, well, Mars. Andy Weir's The Martian is nothing like it.Now try to remember Apollo 13, the actual event when a catastrophic explosion crippled a moon mission and left the lives of its crew dependent on a tremendous amount of luck and the combined intellects of a bunch of pencil-necked geeks back at NASA. Now that's what we're talking about!'The Martian' begins with another catastrophic event. Six days into a one month exploration of the Martian surface, a severe windstorm destroys Ares 3's communications array and aborts the mission. If you can remember the old stories of Minnesota farmers in blizzards so bad they get lost going from the barn to the house, then you have a pretty good idea of what the evacuation was like. Five of the six astronauts successfully make their way from the Hab (habitation module) to the MAV (Mars ascent vehicle) that will take them off the surface of the planet. The sixth astronaut, our hero Mark Watney, does not. To make matters worse, the last sight of him that his fellow crew members have is of a flying piece of antenna skewering Mark and his airtight EVA suit, and the 175 mph winds tumbling him out of sight.Hopefully I\xe2\x80\x99m not spoiling anyone\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment of the book by reporting that Watney doesn\xe2\x80\x99t die in the book\xe2\x80\x99s opening pages. He manages to pull through by means incredible, yet plausible (an unlikely combination of probabilities that occurs often during the book).  Once he recovers from his injuries he is faced with the seemingly insurmountable challenge of surviving for the several years before any rescue mission can be mounted. Luckily for him, his primary function on the crew was botanist and mechanical engineer, skills vital if he is going to turn dead dirt from the planet\xe2\x80\x99s surface into living soil and then manufacture enough water to grow food.  What follows is a virtual geekfest of steps that Watney took to survive that would make MacGyver proud, and how each turned out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is even possible but as Weir inscribed in my copy, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be right. I only have to make the reader think I\xe2\x80\x99m right.\xe2\x80\x9d  That he did, and in spades.Perhaps the most enjoyable feature in the book is Andy Weir\xe2\x80\x99s sense of humor. I have seen him speak and he is a genuinely funny guy. This humor shows in the book in a big way and every chapter is full of belly laughs. As an example, when someone at NASA Mission Control states \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking right now,\xe2\x80\x9d readers are treated with \xe2\x80\x9cLog entry: Sol 61: How come Aquaman can control whales? They\xe2\x80\x99re mammals! Makes no sense.\xe2\x80\x9dThe book, on the other hand, does make sense. It is very readable and enjoyable. I recommend it highly."

aS"I am mainly a fantasy reader, but rarely I found a science fiction book that attracts my attention; this book did. Andy Weir is a man of science. His masterpiece reflects Weir's love to science in general. The protagonist is what impressed me. He is smart, funny, and resourceful; I am happy that Matt Damon will be playing that character, can't think of a better actor.Thank you Mr. Weir for this fine piece of science."
p605
aS'I liked this at first, but then it became apparent that essentially the same thing keeps happening over and over:  dire emergency, elaborate technical explanation of the solution.  Not really any character development, and the later crisis solutions are simply not plausible; I mean the science is plausible, but the idea that someone came up with the solution in a few minutes is not.'
p606
aS'Wonderful story; very original idea...little too scientific, but really holds interest.'
p607
aS'An outstanding Novel - one of the best I have read in many a year. The writer, Andy Weir, must be a NASA or similar employee as the store is realistic and very true to life, although very technical for many people, the storyline is great and it keeps you from wanting to put the book down. I lost 2 days reading the book! I shouldn\'t say "lost" as it was such an intriguing book and story. Thank You Andy Weir!!! Keep books like this coming!'
p608
aS'Highly readable as a sort of extended McGyver episode.  While I found the characterization of this book weak and the narrator at times annoying, I still found it compulsively readable as a detailed "What if" scenario.  It takes being stranded seriously, and applies the science of the situation rigorously.  And science is really what makes this book stand out.  It can make you love science again, for at its most basic it is applied ingenuity, and this book is full of that.  The main character here really isn\'t Mark Whatney, stranded astronaut.  The main character is science.I would give the book a much higher rating if it weren\'t for the first person Mark Whatney sections, where I think the writer\'s inexperience shows.  The tone of voice there as narrated by Whatney seem much more filled with the writer\'s enthusiasm for his ideas than the astronaut\'s.  I just never bought the astronaut\'s tone of voice, which remained unchanging throughout his long ordeal.  I actually think the whole book would have been stronger in third person voice, because I often found myself wondering why Whatney would be writing in this way.However, I gladly overlooked all that in order to experience a relatively realistic space scenario, that replaces standard action movie clich\xc3\xa9s with the rigorous safety protocols a trained engineer would use in such a situation.  As a licensed scuba diver and the son of a pilot, the constant safety steps really rang true to me.And if you\'ve got a kid anywhere near you at all interested in science, please do give them a copy of this book (but be warned -- the book does contain swearing).'

aS"I'm going against the grain here, I know, but this book is formulaic as all heck and booooorrringgggggggg.The antagonist of this novel is Mars and also bureaucracy. Ooo so spooky!Spunky protagonist who has just the right mix of can-do attitude and practical aptitude to survive whatever horrible disaster befalls him next: checkTortured spaceship captain who's haunted by the demon of leaving someone behind on Mars: checkHead of NASA who keeps making bureaucratic decisions that everyone can see are just so wrong and backwards but who stubbornly sticks to his guns: checkSpergy computer programmer who comes up with desperate plan to save the day and gets shot down: checkSeriously this book is formulaic. There's no real tension, there's no character development, and it's boring. I do think it's got the right stuff to make a good Hollywood movie so I cut my losses about 1/3 of the way in and decided I'll just go see it in the theater instead."
p610
aS"It has been a while since I've read a book that I couldn't put down, and this book definitely fits that bill. I LOVED it! If it wasn't for my pesky job and other responsibilities, I would've finished it days ago.The beginning of The Martian finds Mark Watney stranded and left for dead on Mars after an aborted mission. The botanist/engineer has to figure out a way to communicate with Earth -- oh, yeah, and to survive. Alone! On Mars!The book contains a near perfect mixture (in my opinion) of journal entries from Mark and third-person narrative of Mark, the crew of the Hermes (the ship containing the rest of his crew), and other characters back on Earth. Just when Mark's journal would get a little too technical and sciency (I'm making up words), the point of view would shift. This kept the story moving along at a great pace.Mark Watney is the type of person who uses humor as a coping mechanism. This is one of my favorite parts of the book - the humor. Even under the most dire circumstances, Mark always had something funny to say. I laughed out loud many times.My favorite books are those that allow me to feel the emotion of the people in the story. With The Martian, I laughed, I gasped, I bit my nails in suspense, and I cheered!Content advisory: Strong language"

p624
aS"Couldn't put it down.  Though it was scientifically accurate, those facts only made the story more real.

aS'An engaging story.  Sometimes the technical aspects slowed down the pace,  but the suspense  building and KEPT you turning pages .  LOVED the humor.'
p627
aS'This book is an amazing demonstration that a technically-accurate science-based novel can keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. (Like Weir, I grew up on Heinlein Asimov Clarke et al, and am a space program enthusiast.) This book captures the brave and pioneering spirit of the manned space program, and the "Apollo 13"-style dedication of all hands pulling together to accomplish the seemingly impossible. The hero/protagonist Mark Watney is a very human (and relatable) combination of competence, ingenuity, and fallibility.'
p628
aS"I really enjoyed this book.  I highly recommend it for people who like a fast-paced story line that doesn't skimp on the technical details."
p629
aS"I was insanely impressed by this book. It is so well researched and grounded for such a big idea, it felt small and personal. There isn't a ton of character development but the fun and ingenuity make up for it. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next!"

aS'This book by Andy Weir completely made me not sleep in other to follow Watney ! Wow !!! I love it'
p631
aS"The Martian is one of the best books I've ever read. The amount of DETAIL was phenomenal. The character, Mark Watney, was one of the funniest/most enjoyable smart-ass characters I have ever read. For a book that 80% of the story is written from a man alone on Mars, you would think it would be boring, but Andy Weir was a magician with the story telling by writing the journal entries when there was only something to report (or lack there of). Great book and I will be waiting intently for his next adventure."

aS'Martin really has an adventure, which we all do share in this fascinating event,which could happen... maybe it already has.... ?'

p635
aS'Very fun read. Watney is funny and resourceful. His one off lines are what make the book charming. The book does tend to have the "if it can get worse it will get worse" sort of progression, but it\'s always fun to see how Watney sciences his way out of it.'

aS"I am listening to this audiobook at the insistence of my daughter, and can't wait for it to be finished.  In fact, writing this review has convinced me to quit while I'm ahead and not waste another sol on this pablum. What are its merits as a work of literature?  It's a technical tour de force for geeks, not much else.  It's impossible to feel empathy for any of the protagonists, as they are so sophomorically caricatured into uni-dimensional drones who spout off a never-ending litany of science junk.  We get how smart the author is and that he exhaustively researched the science of space travel and the environment on Mars.  What else does he have?  It will make for a compelling movie, as movies go these days, full of computer-generated images, wooden characters, and the occasional explosion.  I despair."
p639
aS"This was not what I expected; who would expect to be laughing out loud at 2 a.m. while reading about an astronaut stranded on Mars? Mark Watney and his wise-cracking optimism gave the story a dimension all its own. I was also reminded of the early days of space exploration, when the entire world seemed to hold its breath and look at the skies as one people. I always felt if we had kept going, we would have been more united as a species - just like the people in this story. Something about the great unknown of space reminds us that we're all in this life together. We could use more of that in today's world. I highly recommend this book whether you're a science fiction fan or not; it's a refreshing and fun read."
p640
aS'Many other books in this genre ask the age-old question, "what is humanity\'s place in the universe?"In this story, we see humanity dig its heels in and fight for one man to KEEP his place in the universe. It is the story of the will to live, and our nature to come together. A definite read!'
p641
aS'Great story write was very meticulous at some points and it felt a little draggy but overall great story about the will to survive.'
p642
aS'Excellent book. Very well written.'
p643
aS'i bought thi on my travels in an airport randomly.  what i didnt know was how phenomenal it would be.  i couldnt put it down.  wasnt sure what to expect as i usually dont like sci-fi but once i started reading i was hooked'
p644
aS"What an enjoyable read this was.  The story is a page-turner, but it's not all empty plot like so many page-turners.  This story has substance, most of which comes from the question: What do you do when you've been left alone and presumed dead on Mars, with resources not nearly adequate for survival until the next Mars mission, and no immediate way to contact Earth or your departing comrades?  Well, if you've got a will to live, a good knowledge of practical science, and a cynical sense of humor that never quits, you do what Mark Watney does in Andy Weir's debut novel.  You patch up your wound (a piece of antenna gouged him), assess your situation, and decide what to do next.  And the next day you decide again.  And again.  Will Mark survive?  Maybe, maybe not.  The odds are certainly against him.  Virtually everything he does is being done for the first time, so it's not as if he can consult the Mars Survival Manual.  But here's the thing: The story is completely believable.  This is attributable not only to Weir's narrative gifts, but to his ability to include real science in a way that helps drive the narrative.  The only thing that might be hard to believe is that someone could maintain his biting, self-deprecating sense of humor for as long as Mark Watney does, in the face of unprecedented obstacles.  On the other hand, since that sense of humor is as crucial to his odds of survival as oxygen, water, food, and protection from the elements, maybe it's not so unbelievable after all.  I won't tell you what happens, except so say that the novel is action-packed, science-packed, and humor-packed.A note of caution: If you read Weir's novel, you need to have a very high tolerance for the F-word, or a very good mental filter.  It's Watney's favorite word, and also the favorite word one of the other characters.  It's in there a lot.  Just be warned."

p651
aS"A guy goes to mars and fixes stuff.  So what.  I don't get it.  This could have been set in New Jersey.  Where is the science fiction, the new concepts, the new insights, the new ideas?  A completely boring and uninspiring waste of time."
p652
aS'I want to love this book; I really do.The subject matter is potentially fascinating, and it\'s clear that the author researched the hell out of the subject matter.  But despite all of that, this book is not a good read.  There is absolutely zero character development.  Absolutely zero plot development outside the "math word problems" posed by the protagonist as he talks to himself (or is he writing in his journal? Unclear.)The writing is not good.  The plot is not plausible.  It is lot like an episode of MacGuyver.  No Bueno.'
p653
aS'Would have been a much better read if the F--- words and multiple sexual references were not used.  The author needs to Grow Up a bit.There really is no plot - other than "oh my...I am stuck on this F---planet...now what do I do?"Parting words to a planet are "F--- you Mars"'
p654
aS"There was way too much geek explanation of how and why. It bored me beyond belief. I flipped through to to 10%  that held my interest:  the events on Earth and Hermes. If you thrive on nerd explanations this book is for you. If not don't bother."

aS"What do you get when you take a little bit of \xe2\x80\x9cContact,\xe2\x80\x9d add a few handfuls from any number of cloned sci-fi forgettables, toss in a liberal amount of toe-curlingly embarrassing dialog, and wrap it all around a central character so fratboy-yuppyingly-obnoxious you wish him dead within 25 pages?You get \xe2\x80\x9cThe Martian,\xe2\x80\x9d that's what.  Think of it as a pop-up book of Star Trek meets Robinson Crusoe for 'first readers.'I bought this book because I've been reading and hearing about the upcoming movie, and I wanted to read it before seeing the film because, as we all know, the book is always better.  The truth is, thanks to this goofy thing,  I'll likely never see the movie until it shows in the dead of night on Syfy.  It's that annoying and amateurish.I couldn't finish it.  I started reading yesterday afternoon, and tossed it this morning on page 256.  I've only been this repelled by a science fiction book once before \xe2\x80\x93 and granted, I don't read them very often \xe2\x80\x93 since I tried Strieber's \xe2\x80\x9cCommunion.\xe2\x80\x9d  And at least with Strieber, everyone knew he was attempting a literary hustle.It's a shame \xe2\x80\x9cThe Martian\xe2\x80\x9d is such a stinker.  Interesting plot potential, primo title; all for nothing.  I don't recommend this turkey at all.One star; the cover art is nice."

aS"If you are a super science geek this is a great book for you. I found it to be overly detailed and too technical for my taste. This is strictly for die hard Sci-fi fans. On a positive note I did enjoy the humor and found myself chuckling from time to time. Some characters didn't really serve a purpose in the story and a lot of them were underdeveloped. I probably wouldn't read anything new by this author only because I don't enjoy reading textbooks and this is exactly what this felt like for me. I heard that this was being turned into a movie and I really cannot see that happening. I mean, if people want to watch a man grow potatoes using his feces and electrolyzing urine to make rocket fuel then to each his own but it sounds like a pretty eh movie to me. Worth the read if you are into extreme sic-fi and love technical detailed descriptions. I rather read about Darth Vader fighting Luke Skywalker with lightsabers, that's my kind of sic-fi."
p666

p669
aS'loved it'
p670
aS'This has one extra  star to make up for my personal anti-math bias. Within the first 50 pages, I was skipping any paragraphs with numbers in them.  The technology was boring (to me);  the characters were not compelling; the plot was more or less predictable. I will not go to the movie made from this novel.'
p671
aS'Excellent book!'
p672
aS"I enjoyed the book immensely.  I admit that some of the technical descriptions were little overwhelming but as a science fiction and science reader, I got into it,  I had to know if Mark was going to be rescued or not.  I gasped and felt sorrow when the supply capsule was destroyed.As I was reading the book, I thought that this would be a great movie, and I was happy when I read the thoughts of the author that it's a possibility it will.  I enjoyed the post-novel explanations and interview."
p673
aS'If you are interested in science and technology this is a must.Story about a survivor against all odds. Very well written and with an uncanny insight in the psyche of the hero of this story.And into the science of space technology, maybe the main character apart from the hero of this story.'
p674
aS"This book is highly entertaining and an easy read.  I read it within a weekend which is not at all like me.  I wasn't a big fan of the ending."
p675
aS"This isn't a story with aliens or big explosions. It's sci-fi Asimov would approve of.  The Martian tells a completely human story of isolation, survival against all odds, and the resilience of the human spirit, all against the backdrop of a mission to Mars.  Easily one of the most enjoyable books I've read in years!"

p677
aS'I highly anticipated reading this book with the great plot of an astronaut marooned on Mars.......big surprise......waste of time......managed to suffer through.'
p678
aS'An amazing story of survival of an astronaut left alone on Mars after an aborted mission.  The main character, Mark Whatney, has a wonderful sense of humor (considering his dire circumstances), is extremely resourceful and has a heroic desire to survive, even when faced with adversity and seeming disaster.  The entire story has wonderful characters and gives a better picture of what it takes to put men and supplies in space than what we usually see in NASA stories.  This is one of the best stories about space I have ever read, and the movie is wonderful too!'
p679
aS'The story is well written, but given that the main character and narrator is an astronaut and a scientist, it does not aim for lyrical heights.  The plot,  with all the challenges and dangers faced by the protagonist, is what drives the story forward and keeps the reader engaged. At times, I confess, I flew through some of the more mathematical sections where the solutions to various problems are described in some detail, wishing instead that the book had provided IKEA-like pictorial instructions. Still, I enjoyed it. The story presents an inspiring  Robinson Crusoe-like message of man overcoming hostile nature that makes the book relevant for those who will never venture to Mars. And while the dialog is more prosaic than inspired, the main character has a plucky and irreverent sense of humor that keeps the voice fresh and interesting.'
p680
aS'I would recommend this book to anyone who loves science, sci-fi and the power of hope against all odds. Breathtaking work.'
p681
aS"The Martian is a great book. It is built around the tension of one man's fight against insurmountable odds, and it's a fantastic struggle. The science feels real (though my wife is a chemical engineer, and she had some complaints which I promptly ignored) and the main character is endearing in the inner monologue that he pours into his logs.A really enjoyable book, recommended for all"
p682
aS'Really good story telling. A lot of techni stuff though.'
p683
aS"Accidentally bought this on my kindle and decided to give it a go as I used to be a science fiction fan in years gone by.  It seem like it was written for an adolescent, but it's way too long and repetitive to keep anyone's attention.  Nothing exciting happened and the protagonist is just stupid and unlikeable.  Sorry to be so negative."
p684
aS"Oh my god. This is TERRIBLE. I can't keep reading. The author is a rank amateur. I'm irresistibly reminded of a 16-year-old boy's first attempt at writing fiction. Quality fiction requires a lot more than just getting the science right. There has to be some skill with the language, some skill at mood and tone and storytelling (and yes, even when the narrator is not a novelist, the novelist still has to know how to tell a good story within the constraints of his narrator. This is called being a skilled fiction writer). His explanations of the science seem aimed at grade-school kids (seriously? You have to tell your readership, in the future, that solar cells require sunlight? My god - seriously?). This guy needs to read some fiction before he does this again.Painful. Dreadful. Embarrassing."

And I thought too much inane technical details would make it boring.But a couple chapters in and I\'m riveted. Author makes it "real\' with his knowledgeable details about the problems encountered. Somehow Weir managed to explain the situation that was very accessible to a layman like me, yet in a way that was both interesting, informative and helped to develop the plot.And it helps that the Mark Watney character is brave, funny, and smart.I felt like I was actually there on Mars with him, as he ran into problems and dealt with them, one at a time. And it\'s not simply a first person narrative. Partway in, we see what\'s happening over at NASA, as well as the Hermes space ship, where it shifts into third person narrative. And bits of omniscient narrative as well.Characters seemed real -- author must have skillfully depicted these characters for them to feel as real as they did.This easily belongs in the top ten scifi books I have ever read, and I\'ve read at least hundreds (or possibly thousands) of scifi books so far..It\'s a tour de force.'

aS"I bought this book in a whim and read all of it In Three days. It was by far the best sf i've read in a long time. Basically it's a Robinson Crusoe story about a man stranded on mars In the near future. All the science was spot on and the main character is hilarious. You've got to read this if your a sf fan!"
p693
aS'I had severalpeople tell me this was a great read. Its not that I did not enjoy the story but sometimes the numbers make the story drag a bit I liked the main character and no doubt he sas resourceful.  The story builds in the second half and comes to a full resolution.'
p694
aS"I have been reading SF since the 1950s and have a fair idea of what I like - and really, I had thought I was a bit zoned out with near space adventure.  I was wrong.  I dont know what made me buy this book, but it took my attention from the first page and kept it throughout.  Others have mentioned the expletives saying they were excessive.  Obviously they havn't worked out there in the real world.  After working on a main-line gang in the electrical industry, I found the language in the book is mild and minimal - and I have to say, exactly what I would be using in similar circumstances.The science was plausible to me as a reasonably well-read layman, whether it would work out in real life I dont know, but really, it doesnt have to - Its a story. A good story with humour and a bit of suspense.I am somewhat bemused, as I never thought I would give any story 5 stars, but there it is!"
p695
aS"Very good book, with sometimes too much detail, but it's there to make it a credible story. Lots of ups and downs. I could see this becoming a major space hit, better even than Gravity. Film will allow for further depth to some critical characters."
p696
aS'I could not put it down.  Even though I did not understand all of the technical terms I recognized the results.'
p697
aS'amazing'
p698
aS'Enjoyed the book. Author uses way too much bad language but the plot was great and executed brilliantly. Yesterday was my birthday and my son, who has read the book as well, took me to see it. Much better language was used in the movie.'
p699
aS'Excellent read! Well researched for the scientific elements involved with enough action and humor to keep the reader engaged.'
p700
aS'Best Martian survival movie since the original Robinson Carusoe on Mars and obviously more realistic .  Despite the wealth of technical details, the suspense keeps one reading...or in my case, listening to MP3 CD.'
p701
aS"Exciting read! It was one of those books where you're sad that it ended."
p702
aS"Witty and very enjoyable. The only thing in my opinion which made this novel less readable was the massive amount of mathematical conversions throughout. I might have also enjoyed a slightly different ending. I guess I have a few lingering questions...Nevertheless, I would recommend this book. We'll see how the movie stands up in comparison!"
p703
aS'Andy Weir\'s debut would be great, if it was marketed as a Mars survival guide, rather than a novel. To achieve said goal, it would need some heavy editing, breaking it down into finer episodes or "issues", plus an index for quick reference to the problems and solutions, the same way you would expect from a bicycle repair manual such as Park Tool\'s Big Blue Book of Bicycle Shop Repair and Maintenance or other technical manuals.But it is not, and it\'s got "A Novel" printed right under the title on the front cover, rendering any oversight on the part of the reader impossible. As a novel, it fails quite miserably. The "story" feels like an afterthought, added with the intention to liven up the mood, a task which it sometimes accomplishes, despite laden with clich\xc3\xa9s, while most of the time it\'s just plain uninspiring.The narrative gives the feeling that one\'s watching a Hollywood movie where the hero can just ignore whatever immediate danger at hand or certain death and crack a lame joke, or just go "Craaaap!". Almost the whole novel also reads like an Facebook chat, with LOLs! and Yays! all the way, which sometimes probably can be regarded as a reflection of instant messaging, but it got on my nerves quicker than expected, I was rolling my eyes before half way through it, and that just ruined any lingering interests I had in the book. However, I did finish it, simply because I\'d paid for the book.I don\'t buy brand new books without doing some prior research, and during my little investigations everything indicated that it was incredible beyond doubt; Amazon and various review sites all rendered the same result. Inside the cover, San Jose Mercury News even went so far as to suggest that it "harkens back to masters such as Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke." That sealed my decision and I bought the book, only to be convinced later that whoever wrote that had been smoking too much weed. The overwhelmingly amount of positive reviews just puzzles me.The influence of Hollywood movies on the author is undeniably strong, it\'s practically everywhere, from the way characters talk to how chapter are arranged. That being said it will probably be an entertaining movie, and I will probably go see it, but that\'s just for the special effects.Zero character development, from the first page to the last, Mark is just that great big boy everyone loves, and when putting the book down, forgets. There\'s nothing that stays with you, no drama, no questions or issues to ponder over long after the last page is turned. As a novel, it\'s a great disappointment; but it might shine as a fictional yet believable Mars survival guide.'
p704
aS"This was a surprise. I purchased the book based on reviews which were mostly good, resulting in 4-1/2 stars.  The plot was gripping and the book was a fast read.  I didn't realize there's a movie coming out based on the book.  Definitely going to see that."
p705
aS"You know from the price point that you'll be getting something with some amateur aspects to it.  But the story worked, the science was interesting and pretty plausible, and the writing didn't get in the way of that.  Everybody likes Robinson Crusoe stories; the question here is: do you think Mars is a more interesting backdrop than Crusoe's tropical island?Even allowing for his ordeal, our narrator here is kind of an annoying jackass.  I don't necessarily believe that someone like him would be picked for a mission to Mars.  But maybe a book like this narrated by a realistic astronaut would have been pretty boring.Bottom line: if you like the idea of a mission to Mars, or of surviving alone against all odds (and telling poop jokes while you do it), you will like this book."
p706
aS"Excellent book couldn't put it down."
p707
aS'I haven\'t finished this book however, I recently read (or listened to) a YA (young adult) novel without knowing it was for the YA genre, and found it to be exponentially better in substance and prose than The Martian. I bought this book on a whim when I was at Barnes  Noble because the premise caught my attention, and while I\'m not a "fan" of Sci-Fi, I will dabble in it once in awhile if there is something interesting that catches my attention. Sole survivor on a mission to Mars seemed intriguing. But seriously ... ugh. The writing is TERRIBLE. What NASA scientist stranded on Mars is writing diary entries about the Dukes of Hazzard!? Not once, so far, have I gotten a sense of the sheer isolation and desperation that this man must feel, instead its all routine problem solving and asinine quips that add absolutely nothing to the story or the character. Is Mark Watney\'s legacy really going to be his take on 20th Century television? Sad.Fast forward to the characters back on Earth and they are the same hollow scarecrows who add nothing of substance to the narrative. When the reader is first introduced to Mindy Park, the data analyst who discovers Mark Watney is still alive, her dialogue was filled with so many \'ums\' and \'uhhs\' I wanted to scream. The author bothers to tell us she has a degree in mechanical engineering, so with that being the case, I think she\'d be able to get through an exchange with another learned person without sounding like a complete idiot, even if she was feeling "awkward."I feel like Andy Weir\'s editor must have cringed when presented with this manuscript, but saw a lot of dollar signs behind it and did what they could. Maybe it will translate better in Hollywood? One can only hope.This should have stayed sequestered in online fan fiction where it belonged. Just like that other piece of complete crap which people seem to eat up, Fifty Shades of Moronic.'
p708
aS"Honestly, this is the best 99 cent book I've ever read.  I'd have been happy if I spent 7.99.The book is well written, and you feel like you are on the surface of Mars.  It's hilarious, yet full of suspense.  The technical details do not overwhelm, but you'll appreciate that geeks exist in the future.  The Elrond reference had me rolling.I would recommend this book to anyone.  It deserves to be a best seller!"
p709
aS'It was a little predictable but still interesting'
p710
aS'Familiar plot line in a different setting. The main character is hard not to love and you will find yourself cheering for his rescue throughout the story. It does get highly technical at times and this could lose some folks, but tough it out and you will be glad you did at the end!'
p711
aS"This is a great book.  I just finished it and was surprise to hear this is Andy Weir's first book.  I purchased the audio book so I could listen to it on my 1 hour drive to and from work.  I found my self sitting in my car a few times just to get to an end of a story.  I've been listening to books for years and I've never done that before!  Very Very Good."
p712
aS"This book gets amazing reviews, so clearly it appeals to certain people.Clearly, if you hate science or math, you will not like this novel very much.I happen to love both of those things, and I still didn't quite like it.The plot itself is awesome. There is occasionally some solid humor.But the book is terribly bogged down by a number of things.1. First and foremost, the logistics. Talking about science and math and how to connect this cable to that and how to keep CO2 levels down and such... this comprises over 50% of the book. In the last 1/3 of the I book I had gotten so good at ignoring it that I was reading 2-3 times faster than normal. It was drudgery and went into far too much detail. It is difficult to imagine a kind of person who really gets off on that sort of thing on such a consistent basis.2. The characters aren't fleshed out at all. None of them. Except I suppose, the protagonist. But even then, the only thing you know about him is his personality. Nothing about his history, what makes him tick, etc. It's all one big diary about mundane stuff.3. The plot seemed rushed towards the end. Almost like the writer started getting tired of the whole thing and wanted to finish it.4. The ending was a little disappointing.5. The dialogue was really, really dorky most of the time. In his attempt to make Watley the clever, guy's kind of guy, the dialogue was something that I would expect from a lame major network sitcom comedy. It was really lame at times, but like I said above, there were still some really solid moments of comedy.As for the good things:1. As I already mentioned, the plot is really good... or perhaps more accurately, the overall idea of the novel.2. It is a quick read, especially if you learn to speed read past the banal technical details.4/10"
p713
aS"This is a thought-provoking tour de force!  Let's hope it stimulates renewed interest in science and space travel.  Congratulations,Andy Weir!"
p714
aS"I really enjoyed this book.  It's a great concept that really captures your imagination.  The author's attention to the scientific and technical details is extremely impressive.  It's a gripping and inspiring story, but I would warn you that if you're looking for some thoughtful reflections on the psychological angst associated with being stranded on a distant planet, you're probably not going to find them here.  The main character seems to be a bit too happy-go-lucky to be really believable in this situation.  All the problems he has to overcome are technical, rather than emotional, which makes the story a bit too sterile.  Nonetheless, it's a fun book to read.  I just wish it had a bit more human emotion injected into it.  But no doubt the movie version will try to rectify that."
p715
aS"Best book I have listened to in 10 years. Do the audio if at all possible. Can't wait to see the movie."
p716
aS'Good book'
p717
aS'The Martian was a really good book!  It got a bit technical now and then but not so much that I was bored.  Wonderful, believable read! Saw the movie after reading it and while i thought the movie was great, I was really grateful I read the book.  There is so much more in the book.  Loved it.'
p718
aS'A very entertaining book. Now, I need to see the movie!'
p719
aS'It is nice to know that kids who love science have  a hero who does not kill the very thing he would study.  Clever, quirky, and well conceived.  A great read.'
p720
aS'Lots of good science. A good page turner. Characteres were believable. I was interested to see how it ended.  Some good surprised that kept you reading.'
p721
aS'A clunky movie from a clunkier novel. None of it is art, just a rainy-day killer,  pablum for the geeks. The author said he couldn\'t find an agent to rep his book, and now it\'s supposedly greater than Mobey-Dick! As far as the movie, Ridley\'s Scott\'s "Aliens", made 35 years ago, was a superior movie and much more compelling, as it wasn\'t clunky.  Oh well...'
p722
aS'Loved it start to finish. Best  novel that I have read in years.'
p723
aS"There are over 1,400 customer reviews of this book, so there is little I could add here that no doubt hasn't already been said by someone. Still, I shall chime in by saying this is one of the best stories I have read for a long time - and I read a lot. I do not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in space travel.  I loved it."
p724
aS"So I finished the book last night after having set it down a few times. I want to see the movie, and I've always liked reading the book first in those instances where the work is being adapted to the big screen. I have to be honest and say at times the story bored me to tears because I'm not a numbers person, and I've never been a huge fan of sci-fi. It was all of the glowing reviews that made me give the book a try in the first place. After reading numerous log entries by Watney, my eyes started to glaze over. If the book would have been solely this, I would've abandoned it for good 5 chapters in. But thankfully, we're eventually given scenes of what is going on back on Earth once they realize their intrepid Martian explorer is indeed alive, and scenes from inside Hermes, the ship of surviving astronauts who left Mark Watney for dead back on Mars. These scenes break up the monotony of Watney's daily log entries. I know at the book's core, these are what drive the narrative and show Watney's personality, brilliance and sense of humor. And to be fair, that all comes through in spades. Just all the day-to-day minutiae and tech talk wasn't my particular cup of tea.I will say I think the source material will make a great movie, and that Mr. Weir is without a doubt a genius in working through all the details. His writing style was easily relatable and fairly easy to follow. I think he gave his characters each a very distinct personality and voice. When I reached the final few chapters, the story had drawn me back in to the urgency and dangerousness of the situation, and I was fully engrossed in seeing it through to its resolution. I was not disappointed, although I would've liked a little more of what came after. A 3 1/2 star read for me."
p725
aS"Imagine the film Castaway...on Mars!I'll have my nerd teenager read this immediately. Math, chemistry, biology and survival work ethic!Every science magnet school should make this required reading."
p726
aS"Uninteresting.  Boring.  First chapter started off ok and then just droned on.  Don't understand why all the great reviews. Like science fiction books, but this one was a chore to read"
p727
aS'This book is like a very high tech version of "The Hatchett."  The narrator is so incredibly likable.  Great character development and a great story.'
p728
aS'Just finished listening to this on Audible.  A real page turner that simply can\'t be left alone.  If you want even the slightest idea of what it will be like when people finally reach Mars, this is the book for you.  Science, engineering, botany, biology, chemistry, all presented in a tale of overcoming obstacles, defeating adversity, and maintaining a psychological predilection to survive another day.From now on I\'m adding to my e-mail signature the question, "Who is Mark Watney?"  Those who know the answer will be far ahead of those who don\'t.'
p729
aS'This incredible, self-effacing hero worked like no other I have ever encountered to stay alive.  His modus operandi was "I just love to problem solve! Give me another." His soft sarcasm added to the character\'s believability.The technicalities seemed to be accurate as posed by the author, but as ignorant as I am of this advanced science, I took them for being true and skipped onward.How many of us in the same situation would have given up?  Would have continued to plug along hoping for an unlikely rescue?'
p730
aS'I dearly love science fiction and anything in space but this was a whole new level of technical for me. Looking forward to the movie.'
p731
aS'A very good story, this book will go to my shelve to be read again.'
p732
aS'Loved it! Fast paced, entertaining, could definitely see Matt Damon playing Watney - gotta see the movie now.'
p733
aS"Would have liked it better if it wasn't so technical.  The author goes a bit too far in explaining how he rigged this or that in order to survive.  Would liked to have seen him do more survival on the outside of his ship instead of so much inside."
p734
aS'This is the best book I have read in a while. It isbwell written and hs a dry sense o humor. Great for anyone interested in the life on mars idea mixed with castaway. I recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction.'
p735
aS'Great read that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Loved it.'
p736
aS"You will appreciate the amazing wit squeezed in between some terrifying suspense. This is such a tense adventure - you get one part morbid curiosity wondering how many different ways he can die, and another part stubborn, self-sufficient hero that can solve almost anything. It's a absolutely perfect effect, teaching so much about the attitude of someone whose job is to fail over and over until they get it right (survive, that is). I never thought I'd see a cool engineer as a main character. I'm so glad I read this!"
p737
aS'This book brings together a great character with a seemingly insurmountable problem.  It is written in a fresh funny voice that makes you a fan if the main character, the story and the author'
p738
aS'Great - hope the movie does it justice.'
p739
aS"A real page turner. Smart science and engaging suspense! One of the best books I've read in a long time."
p740
aS'I want a movie of this SO BAD!'
p741
aS'The first four words of the book drew me in!  The first thing they teach you in writing class is to have a good "grabber".  This book instantly grabbed me!  The main character is smart, witty, and entertaining.  He cracks all kind of jokes that make you laugh out loud, and have your surrounding peers looking at you like you\'re crazy.  You would think a man being stuck on Mars would be totally boring....Boy are you wrong!  This book is energetic, funny, thrilling, and and absolute joy.  Brew up a nice cup of tea, find your favorite reading spot, and put your phone on "do not disturb", because once you start....you wont be abel to stop....Enjoy!'
p742
aS"While The Martian was well researched and thought out by the author, I was put off by the pervasive vulgar language, the constant dropping of F-bombs by not only the main character, but also by virtually all the other characters in the book. If Wier's depiction of NASA and JPL employees' mode of speech is accurate, then that would indicate how unprofessional they are. I am an engineer and the kind of language used in the book would simply not be tolerated in my workplace. I am not some puritanical lily-livered woos that has never heard that kind of language. People get angry and slip from time to time, even in the workplace. But constant, pervasive vulgarity is so over-the-top as to be completely unrealistic in a professional environment. On the other hand, if this is the way most professionals really speak, (which we get a constant diet of in TV and movies), then perhaps this nation is ripe for destruction. That said, the book was suspenseful and interesting. I don't believe that I can recommend it to most readers in good conscience, however."
p743
aS"Pros: good spin on cast away scenario, with nice techno twists.Cons: Wish there was more character development. Book focuses on action, little on character's thoughts, feelings or anxiety. Plot in third act becomes formulaic and studded withe deus ex machina moments.Unnecessary F* bombs, in otherwise very kids friendly book."
p744
aS"An action packed survival take on the space exploration to Mars and Man. Loved the humor throughout, techy/scientific language and NASA. I can't wait to see the movie!"
p745
aS'I really enjoyed the novel on a number of levels.  First the story telling is first rate and the novel is suspenseful enough that it makes it hard to put down.  The main character, Mark Whatney, is well developed and although he is a bit of a "superhero" it is not so out of the mainstream that he isn\'t reflective of some of the people I\'ve met.  He is smart, clever, and inventive.  I\'m appreciative that most of the science seems spot on.  There are no green Martian temptresses, no worp drives, no deus ex machina.  Just reality based science.  In a way this novel parallels what the real Apollo 13 astronauts had to do to overcome the damage to their ship:  NASA couldn\'t send a rescue mission, they had to solve the problems with items at hand, there were a number of problems to deal with, and not coming up with viable solutions meant death.  The situations in the novel are believable and don\'t seemed contrived to make Whatley\'s adventure more dangerous.  In the novel Whatley\'s personality and humanity come through.  You feel like you get to know him.  Because of the story line, the other characters aren\'t as well developed but this is not unexpected. Overall a very good science fiction novel.  I\'m looking forward to reading more from Andy Weir.'
p746
aS'Fast read, interesting very well done. Once I started reading I could not put the book down, the lawn will wait'
p747
aS'A FANTASTIC READ!!!'
p748
aS'Too much technical detail.  I hated the first person log book entries.  The NASA management characters were completely unbelievable. Despite the McGyver-like ingenuity of the protagonist and the very detailed descriptions, it is not plausible that he would have survived the numerous calamities thrown his way.'
p749
aS'Very slow, esp in teh beginning'
p750
aS'Great sense of humor. Some descriptions were a little too long for me.  Overall though I enjoyed this.'
p751
aS'Haven\'t seen the movie yet, and my only concern is that it won\'t be able to go into some of the arcane-but-enjoyable depth that the book does. Vivid imagery and heroism without going too overboard (once you sign off on the whole "mankind on Mars" thing).'
p752
aS"Great sci-fi thought experiment: What if a man were stranded on Mars? How would he survive?Picked this up on a whim and was not disappointed. I feel like the main character could have been a real astronaut. I rolled my eyes at his attitude sometimes but it made for funny reading and his cleverness in solving his constant survival challenges was well played - he solved them in ways that were explainable and understandable, not just pulling magic scientific jargon out of nowhere. The chapters moved the action steadily along and the dialogue (and monologue) was good. NASA felt a little flat but they weren't the focus so that minor fault was easy to forgive. Overall the plot was entertaining and grounded in solid knowledge of space exploration and science, which is always a plus for a sci-fi action novel. None of the things that happened to the character were implausible, although he was VERY lucky to survive them all. And I loved the tie-in mentions of previous Mars expeditions like Pathfinder. This is the kind of book that makes a great action movie, because there's so much going on that can show up well on the screen with dramatic music and sweeping shots of the red planet."
p753
aS'I read this in less than twenty-four hours; truly a story you want to keep reading. Above all else the attention to technical detail and lack of bulls*** elevate this book to recommendation worthiness.'
p754
aS"For Me it was very much like listening to someone read the phone book.  I'm sure it's me and not the book."
p755
aS"I was really excited about this book after reading all of the reviews and was ready to really sink my teeth into it. However, once I got going I found it very dry reading, lots of scientific info on how this that or the other thing works.....if that's your cup of tea great! I however gave up on it after 4 or 4 chapters."
p756
aS'I hope the movie is better than the book!'
p757
aS'Loved it...made me laugh while I sat on the edge of my seat!'
p758
aS'The Martian, by Andy Weir is a gripping adventure story told in a calm and humorous way by an astronaut stranded on Mars in a freak accident.  It\xe2\x80\x99s got action,adventure, bad puns, 1970\xe2\x80\x99s sitcom awareness, disco-dissing and a fairly realistic approach to a completely possible scenario.  This is science fiction where the science is real, friends.  The fiction is the story, not the possibilities.What really makes this book is the audiobook\xe2\x80\x99s narrator, who adds just the right amount of pathos, black humor, and sense of desperation to the astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s voice.  Did I mention that the stranded astronaut is cut off from NASA and they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know he\xe2\x80\x99s alive?Awesome, awesome book.  The most refreshing bit of science fiction I have read in a year, The Martian is up for every award in the science fiction world, and it damn well should be.  Also, the link here is to the audiobook which is a paltry ten bucks.  Pay the money and you can thank me later.'
p759
aS"The Martian by Andy Weir is a modern day man vs nature novel set on Mars. The protagonist, Mark Wattney--and primary narrator, has an enjoyable snarky tone that really helps to set the mood as he logs his time stranded on Mars. As Wattney attempts to survive on the unforgiving planet making use of equipment and rations that were never intended to sustain human life for long, the reader gets to become acquainted with our hero and an enjoyable technical writing style.Overall I would highly recommend this to sci-fi fans, just don't expect, a super serious tone."
p760
aS'This was really interesting, and somewhat believable. A great read'
p761
aS'Fun, very interesting and very well thought out.  It isn\'t far into the book one feels like "this is for real"!  Great quick read.'
p762
aS'This novel is a quick, fun read. Although it\'s full of scientific information, it\'s not too complicated for the science novice (like me). I liked the journal style for revealing the protagonist\'s thoughts, and I also liked the juxtaposition of the "back on Earth" scenarios with the journal entries. Once I started, I didn\'t want to put it down.'
p763
aS"A well written book with a fresh approach. Rumors have it that it may become a film? It kept the reader on edge as to what will happen next. I highly recommend it to any true Sci-Fi fans. A bonus: the first e-book I've read in a long, long time with NO misprints or typos. Kudos to whomever is responsible for proof reading this novel. I'd like to see more from Mr. Weir."
p764
aS"The beginning of this book seemed like a really long word problem, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  Also, it made me walk around trying to describe the science behind pretty much everything I saw.  I loved it, and now I need to go see if the movie does it justice."
p765
aS"Most technically sound SciFi that I've read. Good story, kept my attention. Basic style of writing that worked in the context."
p766
aS'My expectation for this book was modest and I ended up loving it. I took hour long breaks to the bathroom at work to read it, caught a couple of paragraphs at red lights and fed my kids McDonalds so I could read while they happily ate stuff they never get.  Well written and well done.'
p767
aS"I read the self-published Kindle edition of this book about a year and a half ago before it was picked up by Crown.I enjoyed the story and stuck with it to the end.  I would normally have given the book at least four stars (a good effort for a first-book, self-published author), but I was worn down over the course of the book by the over-use of junior high profanity... really, a character that well-trained, professional, and that intelligent can't express himself without having to constantly use the F word?  Also, the ending was rushed as if the author decided he was tired, done, and just  wanted to finish the book without much more effort."
p768
aS"I wasn't sure how the author would go about telling such a story. However, I couldn't put it down.  I loved reading this book!"
p769
aS'All the awards that this audible book received are well deserved. The narration is amazing, more specifically instead of just reading the book the voice actor does just that giving different voices to different characters in the book as well as making Mark Watney sound like a bada**.'
p770
aS'Ok. Let me begin by saying WOW! Mad, crazy scientist props to Andy Weir, a self proclaimed "space nerd and devoted hobbyist of subjects such as relativistic physics, orbital mechanics, and the history of manned space flight." Geez. My hobbies consist of reading, collecting Louisiana Festival posters, and Nutcrackers. Um. Obviously, Weir is extremely brilliant. His bio says he was hired by a national laboratory at the age of fifteen. Weir was a programmer at fifteen!! I was just getting my driving license. His debut novel, The Martian, is now a major motion picture. Of course, as popular as both are, you didn\'t need me to tell you any of this. I haven\'t seen the movie yet but it\'s easy to picture Matt Damon as the book\'s hero, Mark Watney. I can easily imagine Damon doing the character of Watney a great, sarcastic-comedic turn. Well played, Hollywood!Now, on to my short and sweet review. Because I\'m a bit behind in reading, this book has already been widely read and reviewed. I can\'t think of much I can add to opinion and therefore, I will keep it simple. If you\'re a fan of sci-fi, NASA, physics, science, and chemistry, by all means, run to your local bookstore or library and grab a copy. Liking math is also a plus. There\'s lots of all these things mentioned many, many times. Math, science, and chemistry...not exactly my thing. Once Watney started calculations my mind began to spin. Watney describes it best when he says,"Remember those old math questions you had in algebra class? Where water is entering a container at a certain rate and leaving at a different rate and you need to figure out when it\'ll empty? Well, that concept is critical to the "Mark Watney doesn\'t die" project I\'m working on."Watney cleverly narrates the story from Mars by making daily log entries. Well, actually it\'s "sol" entries. One sol on Mars is equal to one Earth day. Watney will be spending lots of sols on Mars. Alone. He\'s clever, though. Reminds me of Macgyver, if Macgyver had been an astronaut and a botanist. On Earth, the story revolves around mission control and those in charge. In space, we get a feel for things from Watney\'s surviving crew members from the aborted, failed mission that has stranded Watney on Mars. The entire world holds their breath and actually works together to save a human life. Every effort is made to return Mark Watney to Earth. All in all, it\'s really an incredible story. Kudos to Weir for the highly scientific aspect of everything. I mean, he had to do some serious thinking to put this story, with all the pieces in the right place, together. Some of Watney\'s explanations become tediously boring. Have patience. Once the story gets in gear, it\'s a nail bighter. Exciting stuff! I wouldn\'t recommend this book to everyone. And I\'m just going to come out and say it, something I rarely say, this is probably much better as a movie. *ducks to avoid flying debris being thrown by other readers* What?! I said I liked this book. I really did!**Received an ARC from Blogging for Books in exchange for review.'
p771
aS'Great sci-fi. Not much of a suspense in the end though..'
p772
aS'Had me rooting for Mark Whatney the whole time and kept me in suspense, wanting to know what happens next!'
p773
aS"Everyone likes a survival story and a lot of people like stories in space. This book is a survival story in space and the author did a great job making it scientifically accurate.The story is about an astronaut stranded on Mars and his struggle to survive one problem at a time using what is available to him. I don't want to spoil it but the book is a very entertaining and light read."
p774
aS"Bought it as soon as I saw the movie trailer (movie soon to be released, starring Matt Damon). I don't know how Hollywood will do this book justice! Really enjoyable read for this Sci-Fi buff. Reminded me a lot of the movie Red Planet with Val Kilmer and Carrie-Ann Moss, but I have a hunch that movie borrowed from this book, and not the other way around. And I liked that movie, also!"
p775
aS'Not very interesting or exiting.'
p776
aS"I really didn't think I'd like this book because I'm not into space and all of that. However, it was a book club book and I so enjoyed reading it!!!"
p777
aS'This book is a must read. well written and extremely well told. Love the character, the setting and the intricacy of the plot. Though heavy on detail, I find it absolutely necessary for the story. As the protagonist struggles for survival he ingeniously devises solutions to every problem he faces. Robinson Crusoe meets lost in space. Well done humor and cultural references add to the ambience.I hope he gets stuck on Jupiter!'
p778
aS'I was pulled in by the story, in the way you some times get drawn into books as if they were a movie. I wanted to know the ending and that was the most important part. In that way the book was good. Admittedly, as I progressed towards the end of the book, I did kind of want to fast forward a little. The book is just a little repetitive, and at that stage you kinda get to the "OK, enough, let\'s just get to the end, shall we".Though it was entertaining, I have to agree with other reviews about1/ The character development is lacking or non-existent. Very one-dimensional.2/ The juvenile language of the protagonist is not at all consistent with his job description. It detracts from the overall feel of the book.3/ This is not hard science. Several of the disasters befalling our protagonist are absurd. There is not a chance in hell a storm would cause the damage that is at the core of this book and the cause of the plight of our protagonist. In fact, the entire storm thing is ridiculous.3a/ The bad, bad, bad science that lies at the core here is repeated through the book, and the final disaster befalling our hero is equally flawed. Here the author could have done with input from people actually familiar with science.3b/ Almost everything about his solution to the food situation is nonsense too.3c/ It is impossible that NASA would NOT consider a situation where the astronauts were stranded on Mars (all of them) during such a mission. Given the fact that many, many metric tons of equipment had been shipped in advance, you can rest assured that the notoriously careful NASA would have added enough food (or food growing capabilities) for six astronauts stranded until they could be re-supplied and/or  rescued, and a good plan for re-supplying them in case of disaster, at least until they died of radiation sickness.So, the book requires a healthy does of suspension of disbelief and a tolerance for rather juvenile humor and language. If those characteristics fit you, I am sure you will enjoy this book.'
p779
aS'Loved it! Easy to read, with just enough science to keep one interested but not bored.'
p780
aS"Since I don't understand much of the technical stuff in this book, I found it tedious. I did skip a lotof pages. I liked the idea of a man left to fend for himself on Mars and his sense of humor. I didfind many parts of the book interesting and the exciting ending."
p781
aS"Boring. Really a technical manual. Stopped after 60 pages.Where do all the 5 star reviews come from?  Makes me start to distrust Amazon's rating system for products.  I think I can only trust one and two and three star reviews."
p782
aS'I thought The Martian was an exciting story, well told. I didn\'t know if Mark Watney would survive or not until the very end. I give it three stars because the book seems to be a humanist, atheist manifesto. I know if I was in that situation or knew someone in that situation I would be praying a lot, but NOT ONE of the characters even suggests it or mentions God except for the Indian who says, "Thank the gods.", and one crew member who says, "Have faith.", to which the other replies, "I don\'t believe in God.", and the first comes back with something like, "I didn\'t say have faith in God. Have faith in Watney." (I listened to the Audible version so I may not have the wording exact. Sorry.) I thought that this was so odd that I looked up Andy Weir in the Wikipedia and saw that he is styled an "agnostic", someone who tells God He must prove Himself to him. God is so far beyond man\'s comprehension that unless He made it possible we could never know Him. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." -Isaiah 55:9  "He alone has endless life and lives in inaccessible light. No one has ever seen Him, nor can anyone see Him." -1 Timothy 6:16 God does communicate with man, however, in the written Word, the Bible, ("All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: . . ."  -2 Timothy 3:16) and by the Living Word, Jesus, "... in (whom) the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, ..." -Colossians 2:9 Finally, "... without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him." -Hebrews 11:6'
p783
aS"Really enjoyed the read. hard to complain. there was a lot of technical stuff but it wasn't even boring! how is that possible? I think because I didn't need to understand it, the character did the heavy lifting. good main character. good characters pretty much all the way around. the one thing i personally couldn't relate to was his ability to never get too bummed out. i totally would've gotten super depressed for at least a day if i was stuck on mars. it reminded me a little of clooney in gravity. i really liked gravity but clooney bugged me a little because he was just soooo cooool about dying. maybe that's how real space people are and why i'm a loser reading books and watching movies about them. a strong recommend! keep writing."
p784
aS"It's a perfect book. That's the best way to describe it. I loved it from start to finish.  The combination of log entries and narrative made the story varied and interesting and Watney's inner dialogue was well done, funny, and real. This truly is the best book I've read all year."
p785
aS'Good, easy read if you are remotely interested in hard science fiction. Not all aspects of the book worked for me and some seemed to be written in anticipation of a film adaption. Overall B-'
p786
aS'The exposition of one very creative, disciplined engineer faced with lethal challenges at every new sol demanded more information regarding the equipment with which he was working.  The science seemed credible but the hardware - hab  rover characteristics - left much to the imagination.  The story held my interest even as I wondered "is this for real?"'
p787
aS"When I first read the summary, I thought it would be boring to read a story of one guy trying to survive. Boy, was I wrong. Mr. Weir is one smart fellow with a lot of solid education and common sense. I think NASA could really use him on future projects. Besides being blown away by the technology situations, I laughed out load more times than any book in recent memory. I'll definitely be looking for more from this author."
p788
aS'wow.just wow.'
p789
aS'One of my favorite line s from Apollo 13, is when Jim Lovell, in talking about the moon missions, says the equivalent of "It wasn\'t a miracle: we just decided to go."  The Martian uses the same mind set and gets the Ares 3 crew to and from and back again without inventing a hyperdrive, and Mark gets from Ares 3 to Ares 4 without a phaser or tricorder.  The emergencies flow naturally into thought processes, analyses into solutions (or partial solutions), solutions into the challenge of making it happen in such a hostile environment, and on to the next event/challenge/disaster.  Mark Watney is a great character who has the resilience we all wish we had.  His log book includes his foolish mistakes and his ingenious successes with the same enthusiasm.  He isn\'t going to hide anything from the people who find the log if he does on Mars and he doesn\'t have to blame himself or anyone else for his developing predicament.  In fact, every time he finds a solution he offers up a thank you to the JPL engineers who made the solution possible, even when they had no way of knowing how the equipment would ultimately be called upon to serve Mark on Mars.  A great read.'
p790
aS"As a Mars geek, I'm pretty jaded when it comes to stories  movies about Mars. Most are awful but I grabbed The Martian based on some good reviews. What a surprise. Weir nails the science and engineering and lingo of Mars. If you've followed Spirit  Opportunity and MSL, you'll appreciate the technical details. If you haven't, no worries. All that just provides a backdrop to a great adventure tale which is also at times, laugh out loud funny. Highly recommended. Up there with WOOL by Hugh Howey as my favourite reads of 2012. Support this independent author. For $0.99 you can't go wrong."
p791
aS"I didn't think I was going to like this story because it started out being just SO technical and obviously had no interaction with anyone and the main character.  However early on the author was able to make that main character very empathetic to me.I would have liked to know just a tad more about him, especially what he looked like. I know, that's pretty much a female thing and men don't care so much about being physically descriptive.I really did enjoy the story very much."
p792
aS'Awesome, Awesome, Awesome  is all I can say  is a terrific story  based in real science technology.'
p793
aS'Awesome modern day/space age cast away.'
p794
aS'Boooooorring. Too much terminology and scientific explanation. My brain fogged over within minutes each time I picked it up.Great premise, NO heart.'
p795
aS'NASA Astronaut Mark Watney and his 5 crewmates are supposed to spend a couple of months on Mars. A violent sandstorm forces them to leave after only six days, and Watney, who is thought to be dead, is left behind. But Watney is alive and well -- and smart. He is a Mechanical Engineer with a Master\'s in Botany. Just the kind of guy who understand the problems he faces, and the ability to figure out scientific ways to try overcome them. The problem is that Watney faces a lot of problems, has limited resources to work with, and his smarts can take him just so far. He might never make it back to Earth, or even live to the end of each day. The tech stuff is explained is pretty simple terms, and this story of an astronaut who, in effect, builds a  small life boat on a big planet is "a can\'t put it down," adventure.If you enjoyed the story of Apollo 13, this is Apollo 13 on steroids.'
p796
aS'Love the science in this book. Great tension and nice way to write about Mars. It was a good book.'
p797
aS'Wonderful story, brilliant voice, great read. Ready to see the movie!'
p798
aS"although I haven't finished the book, the first many chapters less than the first couple few are extremely boring, putting to sleep boring, about too many figures and number calculations about the Martian's available converted potato farmland. Who cares?! And his corny expressions, nobody talks like that especially to them self! Also with only one character so far if it doesn't change soon because it's putting me to sleep! Hopefully I can stay awake for the rest of the book!"
p799
aS'Technically there may be some faults in the science, but the read is gripping and entertaining.  I may even go see the movie...  You will never think of survival the same way again.'
p800
aS"Entertaining, imaginative and nerdy - just how I like it! Picked it up and didn't put it down until it was done."
p801
aS'Excellent science fiction. Characters were interesting, plot was fun, and the pacing was great. Excellent find and a great read.'
p802
aS"The Martian is one of my favorites books I've read this year. The level of detail and research that must have gone into writing this is impressive. I found it fascinating to read about the ways in which an a resourceful person can survive, even against extremely difficult condition. I'd recommend this book."
p803
aS'awesome'
p804
aS'Succession of problems and solutions but not much about how a stranded guy would feel on Mars. I skipped most of the solutions after the forth problems, getting too bored reading the technical detail. Probably a cool book if you are engineer, for the rest of us it gets way too repetitive'
p805
aS"I thought it was going to be your run of the mill sci-fi survival horror book....GLAD I was wrong.  It is a tale of survival and humor on a planet where even bacteria can't survive.  Imagine if MacGuyver got trapped on Mars and had to survive long enough to escape, now combine that with razor sharp humor, excellent pacing, and suspenseful moments that have you rooting for the protagonist the whole book.  I was quite impressed and will definitely be looking for future books by Mr. Weir."
p806
aS"The BEST fiction novel I remember reading in a very long time. Loved the character development.... Mark Wattney is a tenacious, unpretentious guy that you invite over for a beer and BBS's on Saturday."
p807
aS'Much more interesting than I thought it would be. Narrator has a good sense of humor, and it is easy to appreciate just how clever he is. Makes me sorry the space race has slackened. Good book.'
p808
aS"My new favorite book.For me that's saying something.  Andy Weir brings the science back to science fiction.Write many more Mr Weir.  I will buy it all."
p809
aS"I didn't fact check this book, so I don't know how accurate the details are, but they certainly rang true.  Enjoyable and entertaining, and well worth the price of admission.  I look forward to reading more from this author."
p810
aS"I wasn't really interested in the premise but I was told it was good.  Actually started reading 2 books at the same time to see what I wanted to read.  This one won me right away.  Smart, funny, and educational.  One of those books where it doesn't feel like you're reading it."
p811
aS'Awesome book.  Quick, fun read.'
p812
aS'A great read.  Thoroughly enjoyed the characters.  Hard to put down!'
p813
aS'great book to read - I was there with Mark........ Science brought to show problems can be solved with a cool head and knowledge'
p814
aS"A lot of unnecessary swearing.  In places that didn't even make sense.  The story was good though.  Just shows an author's lack of creation when he needs to turn to swearing for no reason"
p815
aS"Actually I didn't read it, I listened to it by the best narrator I've ever heard.  Andy Weir has a well of a sense of humor."
p816
aS'The Martian is a fast-paced story that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put down, yet it left me wondering why I liked it so much. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly as well-plotted as the best thriller, with lots of unexpected twists and turns. It has a protagonist that overcomes an ever increasing series of obstacles, all in the most inhospitable environment imaginable\xe2\x80\x94even the least miscalculation can lead to instant death.But the premise is hardly original\xe2\x80\x94think a blend of Robinson Crusoe on Mars and Apollo 13. The writing, while competent, clean and easy to read, has few of those \xe2\x80\x9coh wow\xe2\x80\x9d passages. The characters, with the exception of the main one, the poor soul left to survive on his own on Mars, are mostly stock characters: various NASA types, the stereotypical software nerd with limited social skills, who\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant analysis finds the solution to the dilemma, the young woman with the master\xe2\x80\x99s degree, dissatisfied with her role watching satellites, who discovers the hero alive.So why did I like it so much? First, the many obstacles are not overcome with brawn or violence or rallying the people against the evil empire, but rather through a combination of MacGyver-like ingenuity and science. And there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of science. Some like me (I have a background in software), will find it fascinating. Others may find some technical sections a bit slow, but don\xe2\x80\x99t give up. They make the story credible, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t follow all the details.In addition, the tale is told with a light touch, a mix of cynicism and nerd humor (e.g. \xe2\x80\x9cEven NASA can\xe2\x80\x99t improve on duct tape.\xe2\x80\x9d). And while there are no long inner monologues or characters ruminating about their fate, the sense of their inner lives comes across in their actions.Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the main character. His point-of-view is told in first person through recorded logs. He faces what seems to be the most precarious situations with understated humor and a typical astronaut can-do attitude, but somehow we get to know him intimately, so much so that we come to care deeply what happens to him. I can see the upcoming movie ending, and people standing in the aisles and cheering.And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think the book is so good. There are many different ways to show the triumph of the human spirit. The Martian is certainly a shining example of one.'
p817
aS"Wow. Wow. Wow. So well written. Funny, engaging, witty, intelligent. I read this book in one sitting because it was so enjoyable.There's a lot of science and problem-solving in here, and the writing style is very accessible. I'd recommend this book to everyone. All ages. Everyone."
p818
aS"This is one of those books that will keep you up way past your bedtime,  because you won't be able to put it down."
p819
aS"Not my typical reading choice but I'm glad I tried it. Mark Whatney is alone on Mars and needs to survive until he is rescued.  Similar to Castaway but set on Mars.  Interesting, suspenseful, worth the time."
p820
aS'When the cussing starts on the first page, in the first sentence, and it makes sense for it to be there, you know you are in for an interesting tale.  One of the funniest best written books I have read from the .99 Amazon collection.  I read a lot of these looking for gems and this one is a diamond.'
p821
aS'I picked up "The Martian" to be mostly sci-fi. It\'s a good read for anyone into science and manned space flights.For anyone else this can be a slow read and readers will recognize the basic plot from a hundred other books and movies.'
p822
aS'Starts off rather slow but picks up!'
p823
aS"The first astronauts on Mars establish a base camp and battle the harsh Martian elements as they carry out their various assignments.  A severe storm tears up the camp and forces them to abandon their mission and to blast-off prematurely for return to Earth.  Unfortunately, one of the five astronauts is killed by flying debris during the storm and must be left behind on the planet.Turns out that the dead astronaut is not so dead after all.  The story is about his struggle to survive.....alone on the distant planet.  He must quickly find a way to establish communications with Mission Control back on Earth and let them know that he's still alive.  He must also severely ration his meager supplies to last as long as possible.  Hopefully, replenishments can be delivered to him or a rescue mission can be sent to retrieve him (before he starves or runs out of air or water).  He's a botanist and an engineer......skills that will definitely come in handy during his ordeal.I really enjoyed this book.  The situations that the astronaut encounters and his solutions for dealing with them.......all seem so very `real'.  I was totally drawn-in to his lonely, desperate world.  He is constantly jury rigging and cannibalizing his equipment as he adapts to his situation, trying to get the most out of everything that's available to him.  His troubleshooting steps are logical and easy to follow (even if you can't fully understand some of the more complex procedures).  Whenever he would have a great triumph, I would find myself cheering.....right along with the mission controllers of the story.  That's how drawn-in I was.Book is very well written and edited. I bought the audio edition and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to a lot more from this author."
p824
aS'Total garbage.  Space Quest computer game wrapped in cheap patriotic crap.'
p825
aS"Got this to read in advance of the movie. This was a great read and I would recommend. After you're done, be sure to page forward to the author's blog about writing the story. That story in itself is also great."
p826
aS"WHY is everyone in love with this book? I can read actual applied chemistry if I want to learn chemistry. I trudged and trudged and finally gave up. I mean, it's written well, and I'm intrigued about what the heck he's going to do and by what's going to happen, but EVERY page is a science experiment. I gave up."
p827
aS"Phenomenal read, I couldn't stop. All throughout I felt like I was in the future reading something based on actual events."
p828
aS"Enjoyed this book. Light read. Heavily technical. Although the character's personality didn't match the life and death situations he encountered, it still is a very entertaining piece of fiction."
p829
aS"The Martian is a thrilling read. An original story and the voice and character of Mark Watney are very appealing at first.  A disappointment is the sameness of the other astronauts once Watney is back in contact with them. The mix of men and women seems forced and the captain is in name only, it feels like lip service to equality borne out by the three glaring instances of sexist comment which are completely surprising and incredibly disappointing.  I considered not finishing the book after the first one where the female press officer says 'f*** me raw' it's both a disgusting and very male thing to say and I just didn't believe it for a second. It took me right out of the story and I found myself disliking the main character because I felt that he was the author's alter ego or avatar. Careless sexism matters (just like careless racism does) and I find that I am unable to recommend this without a strong warning.  Such a shame because the science and the problem solving are amazing."
p830
aS'Mediocre story, Mediocre writing. I am a big science fiction fan, and after hearing about this book on NPR, immediately ordered it. BIG disappointment. Not what I was expecting. Nothing particularly great, technical or deep about it. Not worth the time or money.If you really want an exceptional and well written story about Mars please consider the Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson.'
p831
aS"I was incredibly disappointed by this book. I was initially lured in because I love science fiction and the premise of the novel seemed to be fresh and exciting. I enjoyed the first twenty pages, and the book seemed to be an easy, fun, science-filled read. Unfortunately, the book turned out to be long (VERY long) on technical details which became mind-numbing with tedious repetition, and terribly short (almost non-existent) on character development, which sadly includes our protagonist, whose shallow immaturity renders him utterly unlikeable after about 50 pages or so.While I enjoyed Mark Watney's creative ideas and found his scientific fixes to be clever, the inclusion of the exact details became almost unreadable at a certain point. I managed to read the first 150 pages closely, but began to skim through the rest when I realized that the book simply wasn't getting any better. As an English lit major, a college writing tutor, and a sci-fi fan, this book was cringe-worthy all around for me. I'm not quite sure how it's getting thousands of perfect reviews, but I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person who didn't like it. I really can't believe this is the same author who wrote The Egg, which is a short philosophical piece I greatly enjoyed. Incidentally, I'm sure the film version of this will be quite good, since this type of pop sci-fi usually translates well to the silver screen, particularly with Ridley Scott at the helm, who is among my favorite directors.In summary, do pick up this book if you enjoy reading lots of hard-science technical details and don't care much about character development. Skip it if you want well-written, well-plotted science fiction and pick up some Heinlein, Herbert, or Stephenson instead."
p832
aS'Great read.  Very original story.  Funny to boot.  Looking forward to more stories from Mr. Weir.'
p833
aS'Gripping, technical, almost impossible to put down. I loved reading this book.'
p834
aS'I actually liked the movie better than the book. The book gets bogged down in technical complexities in between moving the plot along. The movie acted out most of the technical things or completely left them out. The movie did cut out and change a few things. I continued to read the book even after I saw the movie because of the additional plot twists in the book. The book was entertaining, but not at the top of my reading list.'
p835
aS'Great Book  I could not put it down.'
p836
aS'Read this book or you fail at life.'
p837
aS'Well thought out characters.  The author put a lot of work into building the environment and using real science and events to build a richer story.'
p838
aS"This is my first 5-star rating. Hands down the best sci-fi book I have ever read.Can't wait for the author's next."
p839
aS"When I heard how this story came to be, the movie was already showing.  I knew a lot of the detail would be missed in a 2 hour movie so I downloaded the book and I am so glad I did!  What an exciting and suspenseful story about a smart and resourceful astronaut with a good sense of humor who manages to survive on a planet that wasn't meant to sustain life.  I haven't seen the movie yet but am looking forward to it.  I am sure I will recommend reading the book first!"
p840
aS"PROS - the character is quirky and funny and this book is FULL of details about Mars, space science, NASA, botany, chemistry, physics, electronics, engineeringCONS - its just TOO full of science for my taste. I don't even know if the details are true or made up. I want enough details to be interesting but I dont want to be overwelmed by it. I could buy a book on NASA or Mars or whatever if I really wanted that."
p841
aS'The Martian is the best recent science fiction I\'ve read.  It is plausible, well written, and exciting.  Mr. Weir obviously put a lot of research time towards understanding the technologies he presents in the novel, and his explanations read more like truth than science fiction - because they are in the main factual.  The novel achieves the goals of holding your interest while providing a suspenseful story without resorting to aliens, "the force", magic or mythology. Anyone with an interest in space exploration or technology should enjoy this read.'
p842
aS'I absolutely loved this book. A friend recommended it to me and as a lover of science fiction I definitely wanted to give it a chance. The level of detail that the author goes into is amazing and really brings a whole other realm of believability to the story. The main character Mark Watney is easy to love and the last fifty pages made my heart race. Great story!!'
p843
aS'Loved this book!!!'
p844
aS"Great read. Get so caught up in it, you'll struggle to put it down. Tense moments but also some great humour which breaks through all the technical jargon"
p845
aS'Great read. The main characters first person voice is funny and smart. Fascinating science. Great vacation read.'
p846
aS"It's been a while I enjoyed a book so much. It well deseres the 5 stars."
p847
aS'This maybe technically a "science fiction" novel, but I would call it a fiction novel with a whole lot of science. If you like science, engineering, and shows like McGuyver this is the book for you. After you read it do some research into how the author developed the book. It gave me even more respect for the attention to scientific detail. In the end of course this is still a work of fiction, but it\'s very grounded in reality. Not to mention it\'s funny.'
p848
aS"A definite winner here, the raw and unfiltered main character, astronaut Mark Watney, guides you through his survival story, via log entries, on the surface of Mars.  Interspersed throughout problem-solving, technical and scientific jargon is the character's interesting takes on the situation at hand, and we get to see what goes through his mind during critical situations.  An unlikely, but nonetheless enjoyable, sequence of events takes the reader along on a journey with Mark, who impresses with his knowledge as well as his humor.  Having the ability to connect with this likable character really made this a page turner.  Well done, Mr. Weir!"

aS"It's like a not quite accurate science lecture. There are moments where it shines but it goes on and on about minutia detailing science but when the in the first quarter of the book he's totally missed the most important part of chemistry that being LEL and UEL it's hard to follow after knowing that the science is really fiction."
p850
aS'Great story, technical strong and at times very happy.'
p851
aS"I bought the e-book for myself and loved it so much that I bought the hardback version for my technology-resistant wife. It's a cliffhanger that will take you from one emotional extreme to another and leave you exhausted before you turn to the next chapter. Outstanding Robinson Crusoe on Mars novel, with believable hard science and completely plausible situations - both how he gets into them and how he manages to wrestle with the problems he encounters as if his life depends on it. Because it absolutely does!"
p852
aS"Spell-binding!  Talk about the ultimate RV/camping experience!  Now can't wait to see the movie AND am looking forward to more books by the author."
p853
aS'As a retired navy man I have always been a tinker er and "Jack of all trades", but my name is Tom. One of my shipboard classes I taught was teaching survival . How to figure out your position on land, using either a analog watch or your ball cap to determine time and location. Ever really look at your cap. The seams are broken into 6 equal segments so each is 10 minutes, total 60 minutes.Our hero in this book used sol and a couple of mars moons to get around. And don\'t forget the Duck Tape.'
p854
aS"A GREAT story, hiding behind a science-nerd mask. A marvelous premise - not new, but newly thought-out - about becoming a castaway, except this guy's on Mars. The main character is wryly/sarcastically/self-effacingly funny, giving a different texture to a life-or-death story. And, if you're interested, you can follow along the math problems he is continually forced to work out - how much oxygen to last how many days, how much battery power to drive how many miles - or you can just glide over them and get the basic point. Had a lot of fun reading this, and certainly will again."
p855
aS'Could have been a good novel; way too much technical jargon.  Forget this one.'
p856
aS'The main character is basically a quippy, smug superhero from a wooden blockbuster but even more cynical and less funny.Hard science + cynicism = no thanks.Edit: And I mean *hard* science -- like guy at a science fair blabbering on about numbers and figures and trajectories and etc. etc. Heinlein did hard science right. Read Starship Troopers. He got in and then got out fast. When describing a "drop" or a how a starship\'s lightspeed drive works he economically stated it in a few sentences then got on with the story. The Martian fails to exercise such restraint, and by doing so loses some readers, me being among them. Tons of people love this book though. The author himself states in a Q  A at the end of the book that he used the science problems compounding as a way to structure the book. I admire that. I didn\'t find it interesting. I\'m sure it\'ll make hundreds of millions at the box office and get a great rotten tomatoes score -- Gravity did.Light on emotions.Heavy on I don\'t give a s***.The writer undercuts every single moment of potential for the reader to actually feel something with a quippy line or a sardonic remark instead of I don\'t know, actually doing what would be difficult to do as a writer and tell something straight up.Edit #2: Can. Not. Believe. The. Praise. This. Piece. Of. Garbage. Is. Getting.This is the most profound line in the book:"But now there was nothing. I never realized how utterly silent Mars is. It\'s a desert world with practically no atmosphere to convey sound. I could hear my own heartbeat. Anyway, enough waxing philosophical."This is philosophical?! Dear god... Dear, dear god...Clearly the author himself is a robot and never experienced human emotions and/or read a piece of literary fiction in his life. He masks this "fact" (see: my assumption) with tedious relentless cynicism. Jesus this book stunk. Go pick up a Stephen King novel. You\'ll get more emotion out of it.'
p857
aS"You have to like the details as much as a good story to really get into this book. It's a very original idea and well executed and I think we will see more great stuff from this author."
p858
aS'So Damn good. I want to keep reading it  please write something similar'
p859
aS"Agree with all surrounding one stars.. He's supposed to be an intelligent astronaut, but his journal entries are idiotic at best."
p860
aS"Awesome.  Believable, entertaining, and suspenseful.  Great story  I can't wait to see the movie."
p861
aS"It started off decently interesting, but I soon found myself uninterested. Here's how the whole book goes: problem, solution, problem, solution...It gets old quickly, the book is probably 200 pages too long. The writing is pretty amateur as other reviewers say, especially the dialogue. The other thing is that it's very technical, I felt like I was reading an astronomy or math textbook after a while. Unless you're very into astronomy, science, computers, physics, etc. It bogs you down with every little detail and acronym that I have no idea what it is. It's not important to casual readers, way too in-depth. I couldn't take it anymore around chapter 16 or so and skipped to the end. Very predictable, and boring overall."
p862
aS"I'm shocked at how popular this book is. After reading the first fifty pages I almost put it down. My stubbornness to finish could only be matched by the protagonist's stubborn will to survive. Am I glad I finished it? Yes. Is it worth the nearly five stars Amazon reviewers have given it? No.This is a very technical novel. If you like reading about chemistry, engineering, or physics at a technical level you will enjoy it. But MAN does it get tedious. I felt like I survived a year on Mars in real time reading the first chapter alone. As other reviewers have mentioned the characters are one dimensional and unbelievably immature. But the ending was filled with enough action to keep me occupied and the author clearly researched his stuff so I bumped it to 3 stars."
p863
aS'Read cover to cover in four days while attending a work conference. I never do that. Highly recommended for everyone.'
p864
aS"Like many others, not a regular reader of science fiction but was looking for a different read.  Picked this off a list of recommended books.  Entertaining, engaging and a good story, and the suspense of Watney' s situation was maintained very well.  Glad to have come across this."
p865
aS'I love this book. It is the best "science-y" science fiction that I\'ve read in a long time. It is a perfect teaching tool for scientific method, critical thinking, chemistry, math and so much more--not to mention it\'s a very engaging story. I could use this in my middle school science classroom with the new common core standards that are being implemented, but the language prohibits that. I wish the publisher would send out a "classroom" version. Omitting the expletives will in no way harm the integrity of the plot or the character.'
p866
aS'This was a fantastic read. I loved the dry humor throughout and it hit every target for appealing characters and a suspenseful read. This is the kind of book that should be used to define a "page turner". As an author, I noticed how the author broke just about every rule in the book on switching POVs. Zoomed into first, then dialed out to a omniscient second person, then onto third person. Yet, he made it work and with spectacular success.I love science fiction and it\'s rare to encounter a book with this much actual science. Not only does the story seem plausible to the reader but the science reads as real also. The hero\'s predicament wasn\'t so far out and fantastic that it eluded suspension of disbelief. The author must have done a tremendous amount of research. For me, it was a bit too much because I tended to glaze over during the really technical parts/descriptions. However, the engaging protagonist and the dire uncertainty of his fate kept me reading.'
p867
aS"I really enjoyed this book. It's one I'll probably read again. I think I laughed about the 3 minutes. I just wished they'd have had an epilogue. Don't care though. Still great"
p868
aS'Excellent read.  Despite the strong possibility for multiple cliches, that just did not happen, in my view.  The story moves along really well and doesn\'t bog down.  I will say, though, that one must like the protagonist, Mark, or the entire book would fall apart.  It is central to the story that you want him to succeed and you root for him all the way through.  In my interpretation, he came off as very likable and believable.The rest seems to be grounded in good science, which is important.  One must believe everything that happens in the book could actually occur in the real world or, again, the entire story would fall apart.I always feel the ultimate compliment for any book is: "I could not put it down."  This was very much the case with this book.'
p869
aS'I was really happy with this book. I\'ve been reading NASA history lately and I initially decided not to get this, as there\'s a lot of non-fiction out there covering similar themes, and frankly that seemed more exciting than a fictionalized account. What changed my mind was an interview I heard on the Planetary Society weekly podcast with David Coan, a NASA engineer on a particularly exciting assignment to the Aquarius undersea habitat NASA uses to train astronauts for living in confined spaces. Coan described waiting until he was on-board Aquarius to start reading "The Martian", and he said it was a real page-turner. I thought to myself, if this guy who does this stuff for a living is excited about it, I should give it a shot.The story is both fantastic and plausible. The main character is faced with seemingly-impossible obstacles and works through them with creativity and intelligence, although some obstacles prove to be beyond him. If the main character were assured a safe passage through the book it wouldn\'t be exciting, would it?I coulnd\'t put this book down until I\'d finished it, where usually I keep a few books going at a time, switching between them periodically. Memorable, and I\'m strongly recommending it to my friends.'
p870
aS'Excellent book. Enjoyed reading it.'
p871
aS'Did you see the movie? Do you like to read? Then read the better version. Heavier on the science and the F-bombs it really explains how and why Mark W does what he does best, make up solutions to help him survive because stuff broke.'
p872
aS'My son absolutely loved this book, so, based on his encouragement, I decided to give it a go! I am a 70 yr. old female who generally reads mystery,suspense, and occasionally romance!  I enjoyed the book, for the most part, though it was way over my head! I speed read many sections, mainly because of my limited knowledge of this subject! Andy Weir is an amazing and intelligent writer, and I am glad I read this well written book!'
p873
aS'The author did a great job bringing me into the world of Mark Watney. I felt his isolation, his peril and his determination. I found this book inspiring, in a way. Hopefully, it will insure a new generation of scientists who will reach for the stars.'
p874
aS"If your a 9 year old who likes potty jokes this is for you. In fact if I didn't know better I would say it was written by a 9 year old. The author will make millions thanks to the dumbing down of everything. Poor PKD rolls in his grave at the thought of this being called sci-fi."
p875
aS'This is a pretty good first novel. The problem is that the guy\'s a geek and not much of a writer. If you\'re a geek you\'ll love it because he throws all kinds of technical problems at his poor, hapless protagonist, and then works him out of them. As a work of hard, science fiction goes it\'s pretty good. The ending has that deus ex machina feel to it. I just realized I\'ve written "pretty good" twice, so, yeah, it\'s pretty good.'
p876
aS"I'm really perplexed by the positive reviews. Was the character pithy and sarcastic? Yes. Did those traits take away tension from the story and make me question why this man was selected for a top level space project let alone allowed into NASA astronaught program? You bet."

p2414
aS"Great Sci Fi read!  Especially if you love books about space.  They have made it into a movie it's so good.  Imagine you are an astronaut that gets marooned on Mars.  That's the plot and it is superb.  I would say that science and math teachers would like having their students read it.  It turns out math is a necessary skill to survive on an alien planet."
p2415
aS"I read The Martian after seeing it listed as one of the best books of 2014. I don't read a lot of science fiction, but after reading the review, I had to read this book.  I'm glad I did.The book is mostly written from a first person perspective of Mark Watney, the astronaut left for dead on the Red Planet. He tells his story through a log book he keeps of his journey, mixing scientific explanations with humorous observations of his life and surroundings. Using his engineering prowess to solve problems as they occur enables him to survive in the impossibly harsh conditions on Mars long enough to be rescued.This book grabbed my attention in the first chapter, and kept my interest throughout. I enjoyed the realistic descriptions of how he met each day's challenges, and got a kick out of some of his humor.  I stayed up way too late reading of his rescue. Unfortunately, the book ended too abruptly at his rescue, with no resolution of his return to Earth and life ever after.  I was very disappointed with the ending, which explains my 4 star rating."
p2416
aS'90% a good book. I feel like it ended abruptly.'
p2417
aS'So boring, I had to put the book down.'
p2418
aS'Great book, very entertaining, i could not put the book down, the author made the main character very relatable.'
p2419
aS"Great read couldn't put it down."
p2420
aS'The writer is brand new but the story is amazing.'
p2421
aS"I'm astonished that thousands of people have given this book five stars. I bought it based on a coworker's recommendation. I've only read a few pages into it, but it's easily the most shallow, juvenile book I've ever tried to read. It's unreadable. I hope the author is some precocious teenager. That might be forgivable. A grown man should be embarrassed and ashamed of producing such drivel."
p2422
aS"Very entertaining, funny, and even inspirational. Reading this book felt good. And I'm not typically into science fiction. I'm still thinking about this book a week after finishing it."
p2423
aS'Fun story. Enjoyed it very much!'
p2424
aS'Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Suspenseful and full of cool nerdy McGuyver type survival.  Packed with enough science to keep me interested.  Good humorous moments to break the tension.'
p2425
aS'Amazing book - interesting, funny, suspenseful but I want an epilogue!'
p2426
aS"I am not a sci-fi fan, but thought I would try this, since so many people gave it good ratings.  I finally quit about 15% in, as I found this terribly boring.  Most of what I read was a 'diary' of the man (so interesting, I can't even remember his name) that was left on Mars.  Way too many pages spent identifying exactly how he would make water to grow potatoes, etc.  I'm disappointed that I even tried the book - waste of money and time for me.  I most likely will not want to see the movie now, because I thought the book was awful."
p2427
aS'Certainly a quick and intense read. The technical aspects of survival on Mars was especially accessible and made me feel I was there as well.'
p2428
aS'Interesting near future sci fi page turner. I had a hard time putting it down, but it is broken into bite-size chunks if you only have short periods in which to read. The story and science are woven together well into an excitingly suspenseful novel.'
p2429
aS"An interesting adventure.  To me the discussions of scientific calculations about some of the processes were tedious, but the ideas about how the problems were solved were truly interesting.  I'd recommend this for a quick, interesting read in which the reader learns quite a few interesting facts. The plot keeps the reader engaged.  Don't look for beautiful sentences or deep meaning, just enjoy the events!"
p2430
aS"simply an amazing book, I couldn't put it down. the main character is just great. the book had me laughing throughout and very emotional lol"
p2431
aS"Suspenseful and mind-bending; sure to even excite sci-fi naysayers (it's a true example of real science + entertaining fiction = awesomeness). Recommended."
p2432
aS'A really good book, great tech story with some very basic things to keep you interested.'
p2433
aS'Too much technical detail and not enough character development.  I quit half way through of boredom.  I didn\'t really care what happened to him.So much for "best sellers" BF'
p2434
aS"I cannot recommend this book highly enough.Basic plot: During a NASA mission to Mars, astronaut Mark Watney is accidentally left on the planet when the mission is suddenly aborted.  Running out of supplies and with any hope of rescue in the distant future, he has to figure out how to survive.When I found out my book club had chosen to read this book, I was not eager.  Although I enjoy science fiction, I do not enjoy the Castaway-type angst that I was sure would be present in this book.  Luckily for me, I was completely wrong.There are many positive things to say about this book, but I'll stick to just a few.  First, I enjoyed the narrative, which was mostly told through first-person mission logs.  Although this could have been an opportunity for the story to wallow in angst and self-pity, Watney's brand of humor and practicality keep the book entertaining and upbeat even in the midst of life-threatening challenges.  Second - unlike many novels - this book was solidly grounded in real science and technology.  This made the story feel authentic, more like a retelling of actual events than fiction, and also aided the plot, as several of Watney's difficulties were unintended consequences of his solutions to other problems.Overall, an excellent book that I have already reread and will reread in the future."
p2435
aS'This book brings home one concept; it is well beyond time we go to Mars. Our leaders are weak and have no vision. We must find men and women who have the courage and drive to lead us to the stars.'
p2436
aS"Very well written. I couldn't put it down.  It needs a little editing to clean up some misspellings and a few awkward sentences but overall an excellent read. Well done!!!"
p2437
aS"The Martian is incredibly refreshing and different from other books I have read in the past, the novel manages to remain fun and suspenseful all while using more math and science than I thought had any right to be in a book and it works.The math and science are complicated, explained in layman's terms, and I understood a solid 90% of it. Never did my eyes glaze over because The Martian's main character is one of the best narrators I have ever read.I wouldn't recommend this to someone who has a clear disinterest in math or science because it can scare them away, but in general The Martian gets interesting."
p2438
aS"A great sci-fi novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I read this in 6 days. I've never read a novel that fast. I'm not a regular reader of sci-fi, but this may have just converted me. Weir's use of science is according to NASA, accurate, plausible, and meaningful. A great read!"
p2439
aS'Great novel.'
p2440
aS'Too technical. Not a good read.'
p2441
aS"This was one of those stories that you can't put down. If you do, you decide to pick it up again because you can't wait to see what will happen next.  Not  much housework was done today.  I can hardly wait to see the movie."
p2442
aS"I really enjoyed this story . It seemed like a true account of survival. I'm not very scientific but I did not get bored."
p2443
aS'Really good read.'
p2444
aS"The Martian is a good read - despite it flaws.  The engaging story is chock full of science and math that must thrill the sci-fi nerds to no end.  For those of us who are English majors, however, the countless equations prove distracting and disturbing, drawing away from what the reader expects will be profound emotional journey for our protagonist.  We English majors are disappointed, in the end, though as our protagonist manages to spend years (and years) in complete isolation on Mars with not a hint of emotional alteration, let alone the complete psychotic breakdown that solitary confinement here on earth produces in most.  He survives, physically and mentally in tact, on intelligence and gallows humor. Turns out, being glib and sarcastic is a survival skill in outer space. (Maybe I'm astronaut material after all.)"
p2445
aS'1) this book reads like a technical manual on how to survive on Mars.2) technical manuals are boring and will put you to sleep.3) this book is boring and will put you to sleep.4) there are hundreds of books out there about Mars, read all of them before you read this one.5) this book seriously sucks.6) I want my money back.'
p2446
aS'Great book. Very intense and thrilling.'
p2447
aS'Some of the math and science was overwhelming, but the story and writing was very good.  Andy Weir told the story with humor and suspense!  Loved it!'
p2448
aS"This book was bomb, although it was a tad slow. The latter half of the book really gets going and I didn't want to stop reader. I definitely recommend this book, just stick with it."
p2449
aS'That this book has become a bestseller and is not a motion picture makes me shudder and worry for our future. Was it written by a 9 year old with a big space picture book? Unbelievably bad. How many of these glowing reviews are fake? And as for a movie about astronaut(s) trapped on Mars...you can stream at least half a dozen on Netflix.'
p2450
aS'This moved to the top of my reading list after hearing good things about it (particularly from the Kerbal Space Program community). It is a relatively short, easy read (less than 400 pages) and I looked forward to reading it every evening. If you are a sci-fi and/or space exploration buff that likes creative solutions to extraterrestrial dangers, you should definitely read this book!'
p2451
aS'.Lots of fun hard science sprinkled with just the right amount of humour. Great book!'
p2452
aS'Very gripping and enticing from literally the first page. Very realistic plot scenarios with plausible problems and consequent mitigations.'
p2453
aS'The first four chapters were dull and filled with how-to science on surviving on Mars. Once the story transitioned to the people in NASA, it really took off. Highly recommend.'
p2454
aS"As the movie does not release in Tokyo until February 2016, downloaded the book.  And, literally reading with passion.  Suspense even greater than 24.Also enjoyed the writing style: narrative, diary, 3rd party. That worked exceptionally well.And the references to the 70's, I got them all.Now, that I read it, I am concerned that I will be disappointed by the filmGreat read"
p2455
aS"Loved it!  This book is totally for engineers!  The book is written mainly as a series of log entries (like a diary) of the main character.  The main character gets stranded alone on Mars and must MacGyver his way through all obstacles.  The humor with which he records his adventures had us laughing aloud.  I couldn't put it down.  Literally.  I stayed up till the wee hours because I HAD to know how it ended."

p2459
aS'This book wasn\'t on my radar at all until it had been loaned between a few friends who then passed it on to me. I\'m so glad I didn\'t pass it up.I had nothing going into the book, except for the "it\'s so good, and there is lots of math" warning. So I had no idea what to expect.What I got was a brilliant and personable main character, Mark Watney, who is completely crush worthy. I honestly can\'t believe this was a first novel by Andy Weir, because he made you feel as if you were there the entire time, and without spoilers, every twist and turn was believable and handled so deftly that I could not put this book down.I loved this book, in a way I have loved a book in awhile, thoroughly immersive and completely engaging. I\'ve recommended it to everyone. I laughed, I literally cried at the end. So. Good.'

aS'This book is intriguing for sheer inventive thinking.  I do not have the background to critique the science behind the plot, but the author manages to help us suspend our disbelief.  What is a little difficult for me is the lack of sheer horror at being in this situation.  Definitely worth reading.  I just hope that someday our space program evolves to where this scenario is even possible!'
p2463
aS"Even though quite detailed, I couldn't put it down."
p2464
aS'Read the book based off the reviews of Steve Gibson and Adam Savage. Was not disappointed.'
p2465
aS'Really entertaining'
p2466
aS"I tried to get through the read, but couldn't do it.  All I can really say is that I carefully compared it to the movie (which I walked out with 15 minutes remaining - I would've left after the first five minutes, but I was with my girlfriend).  Just terrible.  Your typical formula Hollywood production.  So cheesy, stupid and predictable.  The dialogue made be blanch, and I was never entertained.  Maybe it's not fair writing more about the movie, but I found what little I read very boring.  I regret with my entire soul having explored both.  I knew going in not to touch this."
p2467
aS'What a ride. I have no idea what it takes to be an astronaut but I believe this gets me closer to understanding what it takes. Great read. Could not put it down.'
p2468
aS"I generally struggle to find good science fiction these days, but when a coworker mention this book to me I found the concept interesting but didn't have high hopes. Well within the first chapter I was hooked and couldn't put this book down. Everything from the writing style to the story itself had me coming back for more. I just couldn't stop, there were nights I had work at 6am and couldn't stop reading till 3am or 4am. If you're looking for a great read and like scifi, I highly recommend this book."
p2469
aS"I really love the way this book is written. First person AND third person. I don't want to give any of it away to a potential reader. It's a great book. Just read it!"
p2470
aS'Great read! Can picture Matt Damon doing Mark Watney...'
p2471
aS'I know the book came out before Gravity so maybe the movie was influenced more by this book but I felt like I was reading a similar plot to Gravity.  Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.  It gets tiring after a certain point.  I think the book would have been better if the story was shorter instead of relying on so many twists and turnsWith that said, I liked Watney and his personality.  If he was written to be more serious about the situation I would have definitely given up the book.  Luckily he saved it for me.'
p2472
aS'It was recommended by a nephew so I read a few pages and then family visited from out of town for a week and set it aside. Resumed reading after family and vacation and couldn\'t put it down.  A great survival story - nasa "patience, perisitence, perseverance ".'
p2473
aS'Great book that I would have finished in one setting if I had the time.  The author knows how to balance the deep technical aspects of the story with humor, and that paired with the personalities of the characters left me wanting more.'
p2474
aS"Exciting plot.  Weir's writing is pretty basic--almost like a screenplay.  This would make a great movie."
p2475
aS"Sorry but I have never been impressed by vulgarity.  On the first page the F word is used twice.  Feel free to disagree with me if you like, but I won't be reading this book and I have wasted my money on it.  In my opinion a good author does not need to resort to vulgarity to get their point across."
p2476
aS'Story dragged on forever and actually was rather boring.  Actually stopped reading it 3/4 into the book and went on to read something with some depth.'
p2477
aS"The CD will only play on a computer because of how the media was written onto the CD. There's different ways of writing media to a CD that makes it so you can listen to it in the car (at least my 2005 car) but it takes up more space (thus more CD's and more expensive to make). It's a cheap way of doing it and it's very frustrating considering the whole reason I got a CD instead of a book was to listen to it in the car."
p2478
aS'Awesome-sauce!'
p2479
aS'Somewhat technical, but for me, right up my alley...so to speak. I do like sci-fi, but would consider this as plausible story...'
p2480
aS"Interesting science. Unbelievably superficial. Doesn't even attempt literary art. Just see the movie and skip the book."
p2481
aS'This book was well worth the time, money and energy I used in reading it.  I loved the accuracy and sense of humor as well as the personal drama of all the people involved in the story.'
p2482
aS'What a tedious piece of crap. It was like being stuck in an elevator with a borderline autistic twerp who wanted to talk about nothing but elevator engineering. Remove any reference to NASA and Mars, and you would never know this novel was supposedly set on another planet. More boring than a wet Wednesday in Neasden.'
p2483
aS"I was looking forward to reading this book so much!! After 121 pages I give up!  It's monotonous, uninteresting.  The character development is non/existent. The journal entries are torture to read  through ( I meant AliG through)  The author missed miserably with this tripe of a novel.  I love syfy of all types but this is technical to the point of torture, the dialog is inane, it's like reading Gravity, in slow motion.  Don't waste your money or time!"
p2484
aS"The Martian probably started life as a graphic paperback - I mean comic book.  While the idea of a stranded astronaut surviving by his wits alone is intriguing, the book fails to pull off the idea.  There are many reasons not to like this book, including characters so thin that the weak sun on Mars shines through them, dialog that seems to have been written by a 14 year old, venal, evil NASA administrators and a spunky astronaut who talks to himself like he's a teenager and manages to overcome incredible odds (in fact impossible odds) to make it home.It's a shame Andy Weir didn't have more help developing the characters or writing more realistic dialog.  What NASA PR administrator, male or female, drops the F-bomb in every sentence?  A great idea, but terrible execution."
p2485
aS'I couldn\'t put it down!The way it read reminded me of "Into Thin Air".I highly recommend this book!'
p2486
aS'I was hooked within the first 20 pages of the book! Best space travel book by far! What other planets are we heading to next?'
p2487
aS"The concept is cool, a dude accidentally abandoned on mars.  But the first two dozen pages are an overly detailed description of how he is going to grow potatoes.  Almost 24 pages devoted to spuds!!!!  I couldn't stand it and quit reading."
p2488
aS'Waltzing storyline that uses math to figure out how to survive.'
p2489
aS"This is a great update to the Robinson Caruso story.  Fun and inventive, with likable characters.  It doesn't drag at all.  It was hard to put it down."
p2490
aS'The Martian by Andy Weir was a September read for our book club, The Book Cove. I thoroughly enjoyed the book! My inner math nerd rejoiced at all the calculations and science that Weir included. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many readers glossed over the technical stuff but I love how it activated my mathematical side. The main character, Mark Watney, was a biologist/mechanical engineer with enough witty sarcasm to balance out all the problem solving required for being stranded on Mars. Weir kept the pace up and I had a hard time putting the book down. Mark faced so many set-backs that at one point, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure that he would survive. Weir included third person chapters that drove the story\xe2\x80\x99s critical theme; life is worth saving. The final page drove home that theme with the quotes \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6every human being has the basic instinct to help each other out.\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there are a$$holes who just don\xe2\x80\x99t care, but they\xe2\x80\x99re massively outnumbered by the people who do.\xe2\x80\x9d I would recommend this book to all who love Sci-Fi, survival, space and Math! I probably will not re-read The Martian but I would be willing to read more of Weir\xe2\x80\x99s stories.'

aS"Science? Check.Adventure? Check.Pathos? Check.Humor? Check.Insight into Politics and Government? Check.Suspenseful-yet-Predictable Ending? Check.So what if I can't read the book without seeing Matt Damon in my mind's eye?It's a well-crafted book.And I'd go back to get Mark Watney, too.  'Steely-eyed missile man' or not."

aS'Good book'
p2496
aS'I didn\'t realize I was buying a handbook on growing potatoes. Here we were growing potatoes all our lives and we have been doing it wrong. Oh, yeah, that\'s right, we had thousands of acres. This guy is growing them in his bunk. On Mars. Nope, doesn\'t make learning how to grow potatoes any more interesting. I really have no interest in \'dirt doubling\' (which sounds kind of kinky, but, unfortunately, isn\'t.) Or how many shovelfuls of earth/martian dirt and water it takes to produce 1200 kilocalories. The endless soliloquy about \'s***\' (his words, not mine) was among the least interesting, most gross speeches I\'ve ever read. And, even after all that, I don\'t care about human feces.They could have called this book "Farmer in the Sky," but that title was already taken by a good book written by Robert A. Heinlein. Heinlein\'s estate would have, justifiably sued them. Buy Heinlein\'s book, don\'t waste your time on this.'
p2497
aS"Great story, well written, and keeps your attention. Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out!"
p2498
aS"I fell in love with the character of Mark.  I celebrated each of his victories and mourned his failures. I prayed there wouldn't be a horrible twist to the story and there wasn't.  Having said all that, I am not a scientist so the detailed information that only astronauts, engineers, and physicists would understand...bored me to tears.  So I skimmed over those pages.  The story really made you think what it would be like to be stranded on a hostile environment. How he was able to keep his sense of humor,not to mention his sanity was a tribute to the strength of his character.  Keep writing Andy, and we'll keep reading!"
p2499
aS"It's nice to see someone show up to work with passion. A page turner. I can't believe I waited this long before I read it."
p2500
aS'Exciting, exhilarating, a good read and not just for geeks. You will find something to love in The Martian. Not appropriate for children due to language.'
p2501
aS"Phenomenal! A real page-turner. Funny, nerdy, technical yet highly readable and enjoyable even if the tech is over your head. This is a top notch story in every way. I can't wait for him to write something else."
p2502
aS"If you've read the synopsis of the book - then anything I say is redundant. It is a story about an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars. He has to be very resourceful to stay alive - good thing he is the engineer. What makes this story so compelling is not only his fight for survival - but his personality. Andy Weir, makes Mark's character someone we would love to know - and would love to be"
p2503
aS"This book was excellent. Couldn't put it down. The details were impressive and the idea was clever.The very well timed shifts between Mark's journal entries and NASA's attempts at helping out from earth made the book very suspenseful."
p2504
aS"Fabulous book, been sharing it, still passing around, don't know when I'll get it back."
p2505
aS'So, the content, scientific ideas, and story are pretty stellar. The writing style, however, feels very childish and immature.If Andy Weir had merely had one of the science fiction greats read and edit the book, it would be worthy of at least 3.5 or 4 stars....'
p2506
aS'A very entertaining, well written story.  I\'m wondering how the movie compares, but I\'ll wait until it hits TV. When the "tech" info got too much, I took a break.'
p2507
aS'By far the best science fiction book I have read to date. Incredibly accurate details and a gripping story that will keep you reading far past your bedtime. I just cannot believe it is only ninety-nine cents!'
p2508
aS'Way too much emphasis on the tech side. What is wrong with just telling a story? I have too admit that I could not finish the book. Maybe it got better towards the end.'
p2509
aS'Fast, intense situation. Enjoy!'
p2510
aS"Foul language from the starting sentence.  I only read it because of the movie connection.This incompetent writer doesn't give his hero any emotion without f* in the sentence somewhere.Poor representation of what could have been a good novel."
p2511
aS"I was going to get the book and the audiobook, until I saw Matt Damon's ugly face on the cover. Bring back the original cover and I'll buy both the audiobook and the e-book. But I won't pay a dime with Matt Damon's face on the cover."

p2515
aS'I loved this book and look forward to reading it again.'

aS'This keeps your attention, even with the over-techinical descriptions of physics and space solution solving. To those who want to be entertained without having technical information, it is still a treat.'
p2517
aS"Great, fun new take on a survival story.  Love the scientific explanations for how he gets out of his predicaments, and the humor.  Can't help but root for him."
p2518
aS"Fast read and yes it was a bit redundant with all the 'Houston we have a problem..Mark Watney has the solution' but the story kept me going. I finished it in a week - on my way to and from work. Recommend it."

aS'The Martian was an enjoyable audiobook. The voice narrator did a really good job.The author did a great job combining science fiction with a humorous writing style. So often, science fiction books are a bit too sciencey. But this one wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. It was just the right amount of science that science buffs will enjoy it, but I also think that readers who aren\xe2\x80\x99t that into science will enjoy it. I loved the comedic relief in the story. It was very well-timed and just well-done.The main character, Mark Watney, finds himself stuck on Mars after s*** goes sour, the rest of his team leaves the planet to head home thinking that Mark is dead. Mark now has to find a way to survive off of a very limited supply of food and water. He is very intelligent, but continually runs into problems. It\xe2\x80\x99s a frustrating, but also funny, journey for the reader to be a part of. You will definitely root for this character.I liked how, even though the majority of the book was told through log entries of Mark, there were parts that showed what was going on back on Earth and with the other astronauts that left.I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see the movie!'
p2521
aS"This is the first sci-fi book I've read in a while and I'm glad I did. It is simply stunning. It's not a light read - heavy on math and science, but it's incredibly fun. Do yourself a favor and check it out. Definitely worth it."
p2522
aS"This is (as you already know if you haven't been living under a rock) the most exciting science fiction story I've read in years, and I've read a lot of them. Arthur C. Clarke's child has been born and he's writing hard sci fi!Courting Murder (Judge Rosswell Carew Mysteries)"
p2523
aS'I admit I was initially put off by the self-depreciating tone of Mark Witney\'s story in the early pages, but this changed as I was drawn in.  Andy Weir did a good job.  I call this a "teaching" novel.  I learned more about chemistry and engineering than I ever knew.  I believe most, if not all of it, is consistent with our knowledge and experience."The Martian" tells the story of an astronaut left behind when the crew of \'Ares 3\' makes an emergency take-off to escape a fierce dust storm with much higher winds than in design parameters.  It documents his trials and tribulations as this quick thinker works his way from dead-to-be to a real survivor in terrible conditions (for an earther).  From marooned to rescue, over 1-1/2 years (or 569 sols) passed.  It is a story of pain, hope, direction, mistakes, miscues and an Earth population following the story with abated breath.  Even the Chinese government cooperates, saving the rescue.Using satellite close-up pics of Whitney working through problems and adapting his vehicles and habitat guidance become normal and varies from regular radio contact to stone age communication when radios fail.  Witney responds to changing weather and travel needs and he moves on toward rescue, with more and more surety, even with setbacks.  NASA, using maps created through the Mars fly-bys and landers, provides direction planned with understanding of the fierce climate, length of travel from site 3 to site 4 and the ultimate frailty, but successes, of his adapted vehicles.This novel is probably as good a look at early Mars exploration we\'ll see.  In the not too far future peopled Martian exploration will commence.  Among others, this novel will be used to compare actuality with story telling.  Highly recommended.'
p2524
aS'I was very excited to read a book about Martians, especially when I heard it described as "hard science fiction"!  "Cool!" I thought.  "I can\'t wait to read about the hard science behind real Martians!"  But then I realized about a third of the way into the book that there weren\'t going to be any Martians, just this one astronaut stranded on Mars.  Thankfully I bought "Mars Attacks" and "John Carter" at the same time, and both of those were works of art.  "Mars Attacks" is about Mars attacking the Earth, and "John Carter" is about a guy named John Carter.If you\'re like me, and you\'re interested in accuracy in your science fiction, stay away from this book.EDIT: One commenter asked if I was trying to be funny with this review.  I am not!  Mars Attacks is a documentary.  Look it up!'
p2525
aS"I successfully survived my mission of reading this out of touch catastophe.  I'm not shocked the majority of people churned out 5 star reviews, and I'm glad I don't pretend to have enjoyed this book.  The book lacked oxygen and fresh air (no pun intended).  This book read as a dull and boring love letter to science zombies.  It mastered every possible cliche of and for the techy geeky nerdy science freaks.  A smart author can reach out to the common man, and this author failed to do so page after page.The book contained an infinitesimal amount of depth dominated by COLD boring logistics.  I understood the direction the book was moving (in my case, not moving) after the first few chapters of Watney making a potato farm.  I think people pretend to actually enjoy this book based upon their obsession with intellect. The author without question spent an exorbitant amount of time coming up with this never ending instruction manual.The writing consisted of an overbearing amount of context, especially the occasional F-bomb being inserted throughout the book to somehow portray this Watney guy as cool, clever, and funny...it failed.  I wish the mission failed, that would have granted my review 2 stars.  However the ending was wrapped up in a wornout bowtie and ribbon....something Hollywood is accustomed to opening and exploiting.  Predictable."
p2526
aS"Pretty good - I'll go to see the movie. Lots of context pertaining to how the hero works out his problems but not too much for me. The first person narration was well done - you'll agree that Matt Damon is the best actor for the role. It's pretty straight forward in that I read a quick review which described it as Robinson Crusoe but on Mars except Robinson Crusoe is an Engineer. Expected a ending which was a little more complicated/convoluted but it was still solid.  The only suggestion I would make is add another chapter with out hero greeting his former shipmates and support personnel on earth."
p2527
aS"I found this book to be very disappointing.  The author seemed to be set and fixed on using as many foul words as possible, somehow thinking that it was necessary and that everyone talks that way.  They don't.  For me, it totally ruined what could have been a great book.  I stopped listening.Now, I recognize that there are those who will mark this review as unhelpful and call me squeamish and other choice adjectives.  That's fine.  Do what you will.  I'm just saying that books and movies don't have to be full of foul language to be enjoyed.  This one was, and consequently, there are many people who won't enjoy it and will stop reading it as I did."
p2528
aS"The dialogue is wooden and juvenile (in the sense of coming across as something a 13-year-old would pen).  I truly can't understand all of the glowing reviews, because it is just not good writing.  On the technical side, there is a big problem in the first few pages (although it's scientific plausibility is reputed to be the book's main strength):The author was clearly influenced by Zubrin's The Case for Mars, but he made an elemental technical mistake in the very first pages: A Martian gale is the source of the mischief, but, in reality, the Martian atmosphere is so thin that a raging cyclone there would have the strength of a gentle breeze. The idea of Earth-strength hurricane winds on Mars is an impossible conceit, so one is forced to lose trust in the author's technical credibility from the very beginning. It's a shame, because it's a great idea.  And, it's a shame because it's such a beautiful book; I wish I could have kept it on my shelf."
p2529
aS"I throughly enjoyed The Martian by Andy Weir.  I was really drawn into the book through its ability to make me feel and understand Mark Watney's experience while giving me just the right dose of science to teach me something but not make it a technical read.  This book is not for young readers as it has some situationally appropriate language that some parents may not approve of.  If they are a mature reader it should be fine."
p2530
aS"It has been a long time since I've enjoyed a novel as much as this one.  Technical at times, but that made it all the better.  Looking forward to seeing what they do with the upcoming movie."
p2531
aS'Very clever plot. Huge amount of technical knowledge. Spoilt for me by a rather immature irritating writing style. However that was part of the main character development and you got used to it!'
p2532
aS"Andy Weir writes a great story about the unimaginable resourcefulness of Mark Watney, a not to distant future traveler to Mars, who is left behind after an unavoidable emergency departure by his fellow crew members. Left alone in the most inhospitable environment one could conjure, Mark begins an oddesey to survive and secure his own rescue.The story is replete with details of Mark's ingenuity in using all the resources he has to stay alive. While the details will be alluring to some readers, others may be burdened by the seeming complexity of them. It is fair to say that it is unnecessary to have to understand all that engineer Mark places on the table....that's not the story. The story is about one man's determination to live and to use his talents and intellect to do so - a psychological look into our human capacity to survive.At any rate, you should find the novel exciting (even though burdened with a lot of engineering detail) just don't dwell on the detail, but concentrate on the story, that's where the excitement lays.I would rate this novel as a good read and recommend that you add it to your reading list. I rated the novel a bit lower only because the detail engineering will not appeal to everyone."
p2533
aS'Good book overall. There are a lot of technical details throughout the book, which I enjoyed.'
p2534
aS"It's a great twist to the castaway movie except it's on friggin Mars! Excellent storytelling! And like it says, the science is real - this is science fiction at its best."
p2535
aS'For anyone who knows or really follows human space flight missions will truly enjoy this book.  A great read because it is plausible but still very entertaining!'
p2536
aS"I only made it to Chapter 5.  Andy Weir is clearly a good writer, but the profanity is unnecessary and ruined it for me.  Excellent writers don't need the F-word and other nastiness to tell a story.  I was extremely disappointed that Amazon didn't mention it in the audiobook description."
p2537
aS'Fortunately only spent a dollar. Quit after about ten percent. They made me add extra words to this review even though I thought I had said enough'
p2538
aS'Someone at work recommended this book and I put it off until I saw the movie trailer and then figured I better check it out. I\'m about half way through and I have two main criticisms:1. I did find some of the details of tedious and detracting from the story. I suspect science geeks will love these parts of the book, but I found it dull.2. My bigger issue is that the writing is just not realistic, particularly when the main character is writing log entries and explaining things that clearly anyone reading the entries would understand. Not only that, but he is apparently writing log entries as certain near-death experiences are happening (in real-time). Don\'t you think he\'d attend to saving his life, not wasting precious seconds writing stuff down as its happening? Now I don\'t have my book near me, so maybe I am mistakenly thinking he was logging during the malfunction of an air lock, and the dialog dialog was actually "in his head. But, even as self-dialog the writing is silly and makes little sense. Does someone really say to themselves "here we go" when he\'s doing something that could kill us? No, you\'re probably sweating bullets and swearing up a storm.Anyway, the writing hits a nerve because I spend a good bit of my life around tech people because it goes into detail about some science, but will completely miss how dumb it is otherwise.'
p2539
aS"Couldn't put this book down. A really well crafted story! Held my attention through out the entirestory. Great job!!!"
p2540
aS"Suspenseful, intelligent and humane. You like the characters, you want them to succeed, you know they will given the number of pages left when certain events occur but you're still fascinated by how they'll overcome the obstacles (will it make sense or will it be a god in the machine)."
p2541
aS"Had me groan with every set back and cheer for every obstacle overcome. Loved it. Honestly wish it didn't end. The ending was rather abrupt and made me wonder about what happens when he gets back and the issues the crew of the Hermes would have since their rather extreme make over of the ship."
p2542
aS'I am reading a little every night. At 385 pages, it should last about a year and much less expensive than a bottle of melatonin.'
p2543
aS'Great story especially the science involved in using the resources to live and return to Hermes. Did not want put the book down.  Have not seen the movie yet but will.'
p2544
aS'Very disappointing. Boring, boring,boring. Suspect this will make a much better movie---sure it has accomplished that.  Book was very technical---extremely so---predictable, and very shallow.  Frankly a waste of money and time. Do not recommend.'
p2545
aS"Good read if you're into good books. The words were good and the story was interesting. Especially if you like math."
p2546
aS"A must read! The science that ties into the main character's ordeal makes for a powerful antithesis.  Damn you science. Why do you have to be the bad guy?"
p2547
aS'As co-founder and former executive director of the International Mars Society, I have found this book both lacking in smart science and extremely derivative of ideas put forth by Dr. Robert Zubrin in his books, "The Case for Mars", and "First Landing."  Although heavy in chemistry, the supposed expert botanist declines to plant peas and beans, opting for a diet of potatoes only, and doesn\'t even know how potatoes grow.  He also fails to recognize that the copious amounts of dried human excrement at his disposal would burn, claiming that absolutely nothing on the ship would burn except for a tiny wooden cross left by a crew mate.  He places a heavy battery on the side of a rover, using rocks as a counter balance to lift it, then just removes the rocks, assuming the rover will continue to be balanced in spite of the weight being on one side only. He attaches a hose to a valve using nothing but thread from a uniform.  I don\'t have the expertise to questions his chemistry, but it seems very convoluted at best.  But I am most offended by the fact that he is becoming very wealthy off of ideas he stole directly from Zubrin.  I have no undue loyalty to my ex, but this is just wrong.'
p2548
aS'Wonderful science stuff as i am a sputnik boomer. In the book, there is a lot of off the shelf things available for the skills of the astronaut. Seemed it was too easy.i used to mock 70\'s TV shows "How convenient" gun falls out of bag etc.Could have been a lot more suspense to lengthen the book which i wouldn\'t mind.One star because i can\'t share the Kindle (Fahrenheit 451) book, put it in my library to pass on etc.5 stars really for printed edition.'
p2549
aS"This back gave me so many laughs from the witty sarcastic entries made by the astronaut on Mars. This is how every survival story should be.Looking forward to a sequel on their trip home and a prologue on how Mark is doing back on earth.It's also good to see the dream of space travel alive. The world seems to have forgotten man pushing the frontiers since the Cold War."
p2550
aS'Imaginative and engrossing read, though the humor was overbearing at times. Still, great book'
p2551
aS"Read this book after having seen the previews for the upcoming movie starring Matt Damon. The book was incredibly exciting and I can't wait to see the movie even more now. I have a number of friends who actually work at NASA and YES, they confirm that a lot of the science and math in this book is quite accurate."

aS'I don\'t read Sci Fi, so... I gave The Martian one star because... I am exhausted because I couldn\'t sleep because  I COULDN\'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN! This book is A-MA-ZINNNNG! I am a super picky reader and thought no books could ever live up to "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Congratulations to Andy Weir. I look forward to your next story!'

aS"It's an outstanding concept, truly. However, it's distractingly, poorly written."
p2554
aS'Good plot but way too much technical bull crap.'
p2555
aS'When young, I only read SF.  But for the last 20 years I have not.  This book was a wonderful way for me to return to the SF world.  Interesting, funny, accurate and just down right entertaining.  I recommend this book for nerds and non-nerds alike.  Thanks Andy... now write another one just as good please.'
p2556
aS'I enjoyed the personality and the humor in the character of "Mark." The daily effort of surviving is huge and the knowledge of how to do it was interesting. It was just a bit over-technical for me but the story still keeps my interest and has the reader cheering for him. The constant use of effing was not needed. The ending was especially distasteful where he uses the word in answer to an innocent child\'s question. Still, for the price, it was a good book.'
p2557
aS"Loved this book! It has been a long time since I've read a book that kept me up most of the night. Such a great read."
p2558
aS'Especially good for someone who likes to read about scientific basis for problem solving.'
p2559
aS"I'm very surprised that I enjoyed this book so much. I am not a nerd and I don't like science fiction. I don't like tech-y stuff. But this book captured me right from the very start, based on the strength of the writing and the personality of the protagonist. It amazed me that the author was able to incorporate so much technical detail in such a conversational, non-technical and thoroughly engaging way. The humor was fresh, the problem solving was engrossing. I tend to expect a lot from a book (I'm paying money for it, I want my money's worth.) I felt very fully rewarded for purchasing this book. I did not find that I couldn't put it down. In fact, I stretched out the reading over a couple of weeks just because I enjoyed it so much and did not want it to end. I also found the suspense a little exhausting, and had to step away to catch my breath. Generally, if I can put a book down, I do not come back to it but that was not the case with The Martian. I thoroughly enjoyed it and looked forward to coming back to it. A very satisfying, fun read."

aS'An unexpected experience - reads more like science fact than science fiction. I anticipated a completely different read, but was pleasantly surprised at its novelty.5 stars for originality and a page-turning plot.'
p2565
aS'Not my interest.'
p2566
aS'This story is amazing! Although Andy Weir was right when he said that science provides the plot, the human element he added was just as riveting.'
p2567
aS"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to any SciFi/NASA/Space buffs out there.  This will be a gateway book for people new to the scifi genre I believe, helping stem some of the uber-nerd connotations out there.  The scientific explanations and experiments made it feel like this story could actually happen one day, but aren't so overly complex that non-engineers can follow.  Watney (the main character) is humorous and like-able throughout the entire book, you can't help but root for him.  I'm almost afraid to go see the movie now and be disappointed with the transition to the big screen as I usually am."
p2568
aS'Fun read! Downloaded this for a few long train ride and was not disappointed. Love the main character and all the crazy chemistry to explain how to make water in its rudimentary state on Mars. A great feel good sci-fi NASA story!'
p2569
aS'Great book I burned through it.  Interesting story, extremely well told.  Smart, funny,into e resWhat a great book.  Smart, funny, interesting, and very realistic. No "McGuffin\'s, or alien intervention, just a very smart, funny guy applying discipline and resourcefulness to survive.  I read criticisms of the details on otherwise minuscule details, but they do not detract, but actually illustrate the level of complexity necessary to survive in such dire circumstances. A quick but amazing read.'

aS"This is an awesome story!!  The story is fascinating and the twists and turns keep the reader riveted.  The book could have a wide appeal ... so why only three stars?  The profanity was distracting and offensive.  It added nothing to the story or the characters, in fact it may have made the characters less credible.  It has been my experience that people of the caliber portrayed here don't commonly use that type of language - at least not to the degree used here; especially in a professional environment.  I think this would appeal to a much wider audience without the profanity."

aS'FIRST OFF I WANT MY MONEY BACK....IT NOT A BOOK, ITS A LONG MATHEMATICAL EQUATION....HOW MAY PAGES OF THAT CAN YOU STAND, I LASTED ABOUT 40 BEFORE I THROUGH THE BOOK DOWN....SOOOOOO BAD'
p2575
aS'A unique book that kept me turning the pages. I highly recommend reading it before seeing the movie. I plan to see the movie, but am glad I read the book first.'
p2576
aS"The book was a deviation from my typical reads, I don't usually go for sci fi. Parts of it were a little scientific and went over my head but it was a captivating book and I wanted to keep on reading to see what would happen next. Can't wait to see how they adapt it to the big screen."

p2580
aS'As a baby boomer and probably one of the original "science nerds", I grew up in the \'60s reading Issac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein and Ray Bradbury.  (I\'m now a retired scientist/engineer from the national lab at which the author worked for a short time.)  I always enjoyed the SciFi books that were speculative but didn\'t require too much suspension of disbelief.  Boy did Andy Weir hit it perfectly!  The exciting events arise not from "ex machina" plot interventions and unbelievable external forces but as a natural consequence of events of being stranded on an alien world.  The science is sound, the characters are believable, sympathetic and mostly altruistic and the story just flows inevitably forward.  Fantastic first novel!  I only hope the author isn\'t held to ridiculously high expectations by editors and critics, as I can\'t wait to read his next effort.'
p2581
aS'An excellent story about a man struggling to survive against formidable odds. The main character is instantly relatable, keeping you rooting for him every step of the way.'
p2582
aS"20% through.....I'm skipping to the last chapter and calling this one done. Every once in a while you want a good, fast read. It's not even that."
p2583
aS"I bought this book based on the many customer reviews.  I was excited to get a fresh new novel.  When I opened to the first page it was like OH MY! the language.  If you are sensitive to language beware.  I am not sure that I will attempt to finish this book.  I am afraid of might be farther ahead of me.  This is not what I normally post for ratings, but, there should be ratings  on books so that we don't waist money on those we may not finish."
p2584
aS'I read A LOT, and am always looking for something new and engrossing.  Nothing like losing yourself in a great story.  I feel compelled to write this review because I\'ve never been more disappointed in a book.  The reviews are mostly great and the premise is exciting.  I\'m hopeful the movie improves on it big time.  The execution of this idea is horrible and it annoys me that a better author didn\'t think of it first.Granted I only got about 20 percent (and about a dozen "yays!") through before I put it down in disgust and moved on to something more readable, but this is really terrible.  It\'s basically a series of log entries about how an astronaut with a "trying too hard to be funny" personality tries to survive on Mars.  I get the appeal of the "hard sci fi", and some of it is interesting, but what you get in technical details you lose completely in readability.I was relieved about 15 percent through when I got a break in the technical jargon and was introduced to new characters.  However, those characters couldn\'t be more hollow or the dialogue more cliche.  Is almost like the author is being satiric about what we will read and enjoy.The bottom line - read something else.  There\'s a lot of good sci out there, but this isn\'t it.'
p2585
aS"Funny, well written.The science is presented in layman's terms so the reader can always understand what the characters are doing and how it could possibly work.I grew up in the Apollo era, so I can only hope that the book and movie will reignite interest in space exploration."
p2586
aS"Where to begin. I had no idea this was the author's first book. It flows very well.This was a true page turner and I enjoyed every minute.No wonder it's being made into a movie.It's like Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy for outer space.I can not recommend this highly enough."
p2587
aS'Loved the math and the science thought processes of the main character. Read this in nearly one day. Great survival story'
p2588
aS'Best book I have read in years! Extremely enjoyable also for non-science fiction lovers.'
p2589
aS"Read straight for 1.5 days. One of the best books I've read in a long time. A smart, exciting, refreshingly new survival story!"
p2590
aS'A good easy entertaining read. Hope the movie is as good, i hate the twenty words required to do this'
p2591
aS"This was a great ride! This story carried me with it. I love the opening line and Mark's sense of humor. Realistic science to back it up, to boot!  Very impressive first novel. More please....."
p2592
aS"To paraphrase Mark Twain: imagine you're trapped in an elevator with a self-righteous windbag. And imagine you're reading the first three chapters of The Martian. But I repeat myself."
p2593
aS'it was ok'
p2594
aS"Loved it!This book is unique. In theory, it shouldn't be interesting because a large part of it is statistics and calculations BUT it is totally addictive. I just had to keep reading to see what happened and could not put it down. Even the schmaltzy ending didn't matter because I came to believe that Watney could engineer anything. A great read."
p2595
aS"There are only so many times you can read about how someone used algebra and a little science to solve a problem of driving from point A to point B. This is not science fiction. It's This Old House On Mars! The Wikipedia article on Mars is more interesting."
p2596
aS'Enoyed this novel, greatly.  Very realistic feel that makes you care about the main character.  Explanations make sense and sound reasonable, without getting too "sciency".  Main character has a great sense of humor which keeps the story light-hearted enough to balance the importance of what he\'s doing to stay alive.  Definitely a worthwhile read.'
p2597
aS"didn't care for this story"
p2598
aS"I don't know what I was expecting but the whole story was about putting things together and was way too technical for me. I could not make heads or tails out of the equipment. my husband enjoyed it. But I could not get one quarter of the way through it. I did not like the writing, it did not engage me."
p2599
aS"I was amazed at how interesting this story was. It was basically a man narrating all the steps he took to survive but I couldn't put it down. It included just enough science to bring out the inner nerd in me."
p2600
aS'a fun, captivating and revelatory novel. A sci-fi that seems strangely real. Great depiction of human nature. Positive yet realistic. Great literary style, add some humor and makes for a great read'
p2601
aS"Love this book!  Loved the narrator's humor!  Everything felt realistic and when I read up on the author and his approach to writing this book, I understood why.  Lots of research and creative writing talent results in a great piece of work.  I am interested to see if Matt Damon will be able to pull off the humor of the books hero.  I also enjoyed that while the main character encountered many problems, I never felt like I was reading a doom and gloom book.  It wasn't a constant barrage of barrage of insurmountable problems.  The occasional rays of sunshine made me enjoy the book even more.I would definitely buy other books from Andy Weir.  I hope his success with this endeavor affords him the time and money to proceed with other creative projects.  Would definitely recommend this book to other people.While there aren't too many books I would feel comfortable giving a 10 out of 10, I'd definitely say (for me in terms of writing and entertainment factor) this is an 8-9 out of 10."
p2602
aS'This is a rare piece of literature that feels perfect in every way. The chosen style for most of the narrative, consisting of log entries written by the protagonist, is spot on. The character of the protagonist is believable; it feels entirely convincing that such a guy would write in such a way, and that he could actually survive and maintain his sanity. All the technology feels like something we could achieve in near future, if we got our best minds and resources on it. Everything related to space travel and life on Mars feels plausible: we could really achieve that! Highly recommended for all space enthusiasts.'
p2603
aS'I am an engineer so this very hard sci-fi book of course appealed to me. Well written and thought out issues and solutions.  But it was the well fleshed out characters that made the book special.'
p2604
aS'Very engaging read. Great scientific detail but not presented in an intimating way.  Word choice is conversational enabling it to be more approachable to all.'
p2605
aS"Couldn't wait to find out what would happen next!"
p2606
aS"i don't read too many books but after opening up this one, I had more than a few tired days at work.  I couldn't put the thing down."
p2607
aS"Terrible for all the same reasons mentioned by the other one star reviews.  Couldn't finish it.  Oddly though, this has the potential to be an entertaining movie in the hands of the right screenwriter and producer.  Usually it's the other way around... great books rarely make good movies."
p2608
aS'Fantastic summer read!'
p2609
aS"Predictable all the way through.  Life-threatening crisis, ad hoc mechanical solution.  Repeat every 50 pages.  Interspersed with cardboard characters and cornball dialogue.  Written at a grammar school level, with a lot of science and math thrown in.  Couldn't wait to finish."
p2610
aS"This story deserves to win awards and be widely published and read. Follow astronaut Mark Watney as he is stranded on Mars and endeavours to survive. Written with lots of humour and tension ... and great characters.It is now in my Top 5 all-time list of science fiction books, and easily the most engrossing novel of any kind I've read in ages. I couldn't put it down, a true page turner. I hope Andy Weir is encouraged by the growing feedback to write more hard science fiction, his prose explains a lot of hard stuff simply enough for a layman to follow and keep pace. I also hope the story is adapted for a movie or TV series ... perhaps Elon Musk of SpaceX could be the producer.EDIT: (a few years later.) In 2014 the story is now widely published, Andy Weir is writing fulltime and Ridley Scott is directing Matt Damon as Watney due for release in November 2015. An Oscar-winning performance from Damon will do more for NASA Human Space Flight than anything since Apollo."
p2611
aS'I vacillated between four and five stars because I did feel like the dialogue was a bit hackneyed in places and the characters just a little bit flat, but I gotta give it five just because it was such a fun read. I couldn\'t put it down and literally read it in one sitting. However, I have a background in some of the relevant science and am a bit of a space enthusiast, so the sort of "hard" sci-fi presented here is right up my alley and I\'m totally fine with the fact that the meat of the book is the protagonist overcoming technical challenge after technical challenge using ingenious and sometimes hilarious solutions.It\'s not all so dry and technical, and I did enjoy the irreverent sense of humor of the book. However, if you\'re looking for complex characterizations or psychological drama, you should probably look elsewhere; in particular, the book doesn\'t really explore the sort of psychological stress any normal person would experience after being marooned on an alien planet with little hope of rescue.'
p2612
aS'I found "The Martian" a compelling upgrade of the "Robinson Crusoe" theme: i.e., lone survivor overcoming odds.  While we liberal arts majors may have difficulty with some of its highly technical language, the story did provide insights into the training of astronauts and the complex dynamics within NASA.  The author\'s technique of switching perspectives back and forth among the survivor, the crew members, and the NASA personnel aided in holding reader attention.  Of interest to this reader, as a clergy person, was the author\'s assigning of overt religious propensities only to one character, the NASA project director, of apparent East Indian background and a professed Hindu.  It makes me wonder if the author was trying to remind us that only in the Western World has religious conviction become separated from scientific quest.  Perhaps it is such ambiguity that gives a novel, or any piece of writing, a true dimension.'
p2613
aS'I think its important to note things that the Martian is not. This is not a story about a man who will fight against all odds to make it back to his loving wife and kids (he has none). This is not a story about a man who is using his solitude to reflect back on his life and grow as a person. This is not a story about friendship, love, or desire. The Martian is about an extremely intelligent man solving complex problems so that he can live one more day. If he can solve enough problems then maybe he will get to go home.This is a straight forward book that focuses on one problem at a time and pulls the reader along at a brisk pace. If you love hard science fiction then you will love this book. I will not pretend it is for everyone, but if you have even a passing interest in space travel then I highly recommend it.'
p2614
aS'Strong language but great book.'
p2615
aS"A seriously funny book. I like how it doesn't try to dumb down anything technical and the detail used to describe everything done in the book. One of the very few books that had me laugh out loud."
p2616
aS'Great book.  Started off a tad slow but was great as it went on.'
p2617
aS'"The Martian" is easily one of the very best or perhaps even the best of all science fiction novels of the decade. In fact, this novel will appeal even to readers who normally do not care for science fiction. Essentially, this is the "Castaway" genre story for the 21st Century.The story is brutally simple. On the third Mars landing, disaster strikes and crewman Mark Watney is believed dead by his crewmates and left behind. But he is not dead, and in fact survives. And Mark Watney discovers within himself great resourcefulness and an uncanny knack for survival. More would be telling and no spoilers here, but this is a story of courage, individual initiative as well as teamwork and esprit de corps.Some of the technical details that Watney describes to the reader are a bit esoteric, but is no matter. The reader is carried away by the sweeping depth and breadth of Watney\'s tenacity and technical initiative. This is a great story. It is a story of one individual against a hostile planet that humankind was not evolved to live upon. Mars spares no effort to kill Watney and indeed all of the humans who venture there. This is truly a story of the human spirit. There is humor and grit. Highly recommended without reservation. RJB.'
p2618
aS'This is a great combination of a science based science fiction with a good, realistic mostly story of self reliance.'
p2619
aS"While The Martian's concept has promise and holds interest for a while, it ultimately devolves into repetition and tedium. A complete lack of character development and long show-offy technical passages kill the story's momentum before it ever gets going. A man stuck on Mars, alone, fighting for survival offers potential for such a rich tapestry of exploration of the human mind in isolation, but none of that is found here. Instead, The Martian reads like a sci/tech manual for surviving in space, which I'm sure some people will love, just not those looking for compelling story."
p2620
aS"This is truly one of the most enjoyable books I've ever had the pleasure to read. I encourage anyone with even a small interest in seeing humans going to Mars to read this."
p2621
aS"Well you can read the synopsis from the other 9,000 reviewers so I'll bypass that here.WARNING: For those that care.  .from the opening line and throughout there is heavy adult language. Not necessarily crass or sexual in nature, but a lot of F-bombs and other language. Thus if you are sensitive to this type of writing or want to keep your kids away from it, know that it's here.This was an genius story.Everything felt authentic and rooted in great, in-depth research. The breadth of issues that happen and how ingenuity and science win out was an amazing feat that paid off.Good humor scattered throughout.Likable main character. This is a must for me and I wasn't disappointed.I didn't feel any parts lagged, not even the middle.The ending was worth it.You know that there is basically one character so by the nature of the story he is not going to die in the Act I. But even with this, the suspense was good because he may not die since we still have a couple of hundred pages to go, but you as the reader are wondering how bad will it be for him after this.The story is well paced and logical, with no acts of god to come to the rescue.OVERALL: The actor did a great audio reading job, which only enhanced the drama of the story and made it one of 2015's best reads so far."
p2622
aS'Great story, did not want to put it down.'
p2623
aS'A great story, but gets very technical at times'
p2624
aS"I was surprised by some of the bad reviews because I enjoyed this book and even thought about it afterwards. It kept my attention, layed the story out in an interesting way, the characters were engaging, and it made me laugh out loud while I was reading. There was swearing in it, but I didn't find it excessive."

aS'My reading horizons consist of Paranormal, Paranormal, and more Paranormal. So, when another reviewer fervently recommended this SciFi audiobook to me, I was skeptical. However, past experience has taught me not to ignore my fellow bloggers, and that served me well once again because THE MARTIAN was outstanding! This genre isn\xe2\x80\x99t my forte, and Math was always my weakest subject in school, but pair them with Andy Weir\xe2\x80\x99s writing  R.C. Bray\xe2\x80\x99s narration, and soon you too will be endorsing this title with zeal.This story is told via a series of log entries from Mark Watney\xe2\x80\x99s POV, with intermittent JPL/NASA, Hermes, etc narratives. It was funny, dire, hopeful, scientific, and so much more. The protagonist makes good use of his mechanical engineering  botanist background which lead to a lot of technical jargon that even laymen like me could appreciate. The hero\xe2\x80\x99s fight for survival was one that every human can relate to, and his ability to laugh in the face of adversity was oftentimes the difference between life  death.You\xe2\x80\x99d think that a novel that\xe2\x80\x99s restricted to a habitat, a rover, and a deserted planet as locales, and one character all by his lonesome would get tedious in the long run, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re Weir that\xe2\x80\x99s all you need. Mark Watney made this book for me with his sarcastic sense of humour, and MacGyver-like ingenuity. His last name really should have been Murphy because anything that can go wrong, will\xe2\x80\x94at the worst possible moment. From magic duct tape, to pondering the accurateness of Aquaman, to solving terminal velocity \xc3\xa0 la Iron Man; you will fall in love with Watney.I can\xe2\x80\x99t say with utmost certainty, but I\xe2\x80\x99m 99.9% positive that the calculations would have bored me to tears if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for R.C. Bray\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic performance. The protagonist celebrates victories with yays, and setbacks with boos, and those emotions came through loud and clear in Bray\xe2\x80\x99s tone. Saving Mark eventually became a world-wide effort, and as a result, the narrator had to cycle through tons of accents including Hindu, German  Chinese, and he aced them all. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re a whiz, I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend listening over reading to most.THE MARTIAN was passed on to me, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s my turn to do the same for you. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.'
p2628
aS'Got this book in the spur of the moment and do not regret it! great scifi novel, even if as some say a few of the scientific elements are exaggerated. Basically Robinson Crusoe/Castaway/McGuyver in space! and there is no higher praise than that!Burn notice maybe?'
p2629
aS'The ONLY drawback to this book; it\'s going to grab your time until you read right through it.  Be ready to be totally absorbed and to neglect other things while you read this one.  It\'s set in the "near future" and as such, is easy to accept as "could happen" or even, "this could be true."  Enjoy the read.'
p2630
aS'lousy ending'
p2631
aS'Great book if you like McGeiver type stories. Lost of math and science you can geek out on. The ending was a bit rushed. Like the author ran out of steam or time or interest in the story. It plodded along like Moby Dick for a long time and then poof it was over.Great humor. I loved the protagonist. Good Read.'
p2632
aS'It has been a long time since I read a hard science fiction story that was a page-turner. I had a few very late nights of reading as I just did not want to put the book down, and there were no really dead spots that made for a natural go-to-bed location.Weir does a great job of inserting real science into this novel. If you\'ve ever read about Robert Zubrin\'s "Mars Direct" plan for how to go about getting exploration missions to the red planet, it appears that this was used extensively for the core technologies in the book.The stranded astronaut, a botanist and mechanic, figures out some quite ingenious inventions to survive. It was much more interesting than the old movie "Robin Crusoe on Mars" (which I really liked!) and without any aliens or annoying monkeys.There also were tremendously funny lines throughout the novel, and I found myself laughing out loud at many points.Others have mentioned that there was too much profanity, but that didn\'t bother me at all. Who doesn\'t curse when something goes horribly wrong? It didn\'t diminish my enjoyment of the novel, but if you are very sensitive to this, be warned. The expletives are mild and standard, but they are sprinkled liberally in the text at some points.I am definitely trying an new novel Weir comes out with in the future.'
p2633
aS'I enjoyed this.  Well done.  But I read the posts of people who gave it one star.  Two frequent complaints were that it was boring, and it can be, and the astronaut stranded on Mars has a problem, sometimes life-threatening, and he always fixes it in the next short chapter.  Also true.  I read the book in the bathroom or before bed.  Meaning I read two shorts chapters or so at a time.  That way I did not get bored.  Reading it straight through could indeed be dismal.  I have no idea about the science in the book; it could all be hokum, but it doesn\'t matter that much to me, since the story is well told and suspenseful throughout.  I  remember well having chicken pox when I was young and reading Ray Bradbury\'s "The Martian Chronicles" throughout the illness.  It was one of the books that kicked off a lifetime of reading...and I highly recommend it.'
p2634
aS"The Martian is story (often riddled with humor and sarcasm, my kind of book) of an astronaut mistaken for dead and stranded on Mars. The first page had me hooked. I tore through this book in less than 24 hours. If you're not a fan of humor in your SF, particularly in hard SF this book is most definitely not for you. But for me, the humor is what pulled me through the book.There are some slow spots in the middle of the book. And occasionally the science -- and there is a LOT of mathematical science here -- tossed me out of the story. I didn't care much for the view point shifts, shifts in tense or the switch back and forth from first person to third person. It was jarring and I never got used to it. But Weir has given us something fresh. Hard SF that is funny and exciting. Too much hard SF takes itself way too seriously. This book doesn't and that was refreshing.I'm not sure it's quite as spectacular as some of the reviews say. But this will make a spectacular film. I will be surprised if it's not on the big screen in the next five years. And yes, I'll go so it. But it will be hard to capture the character' sinner dialogue. And it really is the main character that pulled me through. It's a great book. I really liked it. And I highly recommend it for people who love humor in SF and for numbers geeks.A very good read! I'd probably five it a solid 3.5 stars, or a soft 4. I think it had enough flaws that it doesn't get a 5 or a solid 4. But it is a good, fun read. And that was kind of refreshing."

aS"Finished the book THE MARTIAN: A NOVEL It's a tinkerer's love letter written by a space nerd. Read most of it today. It's the kind of a book that gives vision to the exploration of outer space. It was so real that it felt like it was happening, now, for real. I hope more books come along that work from vision - positive vision, rather than the apocalyptic, obligatory, stale crap written in the last few years. (excluding Neale Syephenson's blowing up the moon, which was awesome, provocative, and imaginative in SEVENEVES). I hope visionary books about space travel are a refreshing trend. Judging from the 7000 PLUS Excited reviews, it might just be. The Martian was a pure pleasure to read. Thank you Amazon for recommending this amazing book."

aS"It did get a bit expected to keep having issues crop up. I like McGyver-isms, geeking out,  Scifi and good writing. But I didn't find the NDEs necessary. Well, not as many of them as were packed in this novel.Good, but just not quite on the mark for me to give it 5 stars.  Although I would definitely suggest my geek friends check it out for a bit of light reading."
p2645
aS"It doesn't get much better than this in terms of Science Fiction.  Well developed characters, a gripping plot, and some seriously creative problem solving, all with a strongly accurate scientific background, lend a lot of punch to this modern version of Robinson Crusoe.  An absolute must read for everyone."
p2646
aS"I couldn't make it all the way through. Basically this book is a step by step guide on how to scientifically survive on Mars alone. Boring is the best word to describe. I can't believe there are so many 5 star reviews, I prefer my books with a lot of character interaction and a decent plot. This had neither."
p2647
aS"I was a science teacher a long time ago and loved the science in the book. Haven't read much science fiction for years, but loved this scify/science book. Liked the humor and survival aspects. Finished the book one night and next day saw an add for the Matt Damon movie in a movie theater. Blew me away!!"

aS'A gripping plot slowed by too many detailed lessons in chemistry, physics, and orbital mechanics.Mark Watney is left for dead on Mars.  An unexpected violent storm put the crew in immediate danger.  The crew was sure Watney was dead when they saw the antenna had penetrated his space suit impaling itself into Mark Watney\'s torso.  If the stab wound hadn\'t killed him, the lack of atmospheric pressure certainly must have.  The Mars landing vehicle the crew depended on to leave the planet at the completion of their mission was about to be destroyed by the storm.  Without sufficient time to recover Watney\'s body, they made a hasty retreat or they\'d all be marooned on the red planet.After the storm abated, Watney miraculously discovers he\'s alive and immediately begins his long journey of survival.  The story unfolds as a rendition of Robinson Crusoe on the red planet.  Weir\'s main character Mark Watney dialogs with himself in the modern day style of J.D. Salinger\'s Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye.  This character style seemed out of place in the culture at NASA where language and behavior is shaped over many years of training.Overall, I thought the story was good - it kept me reading through till the end.  Admittedly, I skimmed over some of the excruciating detailed "think out loud" mental gymnastics Watney went through to solve each of the challenges he faced trying to somehow escape Mars and return home. I recognize that the author likely wanted to lend some degree of authenticity by adding technical details to the story.  Some readers might be put off by the excess.'

aS'Astronaut Mark Watney is abandoned on Mars. His fellow crewmembers thought he died in a freak storm. They left the planet before they were killed themselves.Only he didn\xe2\x80\x99t die. But he soon will if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t find a way to repair the damaged base and develop a source of food.Watney\xe2\x80\x99s efforts make for an exciting, edge-of-your-seat story by debut novelist, Andy Weir.Watney is a modern day MacGyver as he repairs and builds equipment to provide a sustainable habitat and the food he figures out how to grow.Andy Weir makes the science involved understandable and fun. His descriptions are vivid. We can see Watney building, planting, and repairing. The hero\xe2\x80\x99s humor shines throughout. He pokes fun at himself, at NASA and at the scientific principles he applies to survive.Watney\xe2\x80\x99s resourcefulness, resilience and creativity endear him to us. His times of doubt and fear make him real and complete.Weir adds equally intriguing characters at NASA and the mission crew. Some rise to be heroes, while others fight for their turf. All are flawed, quirky and very real.Weir maintains high levels of tension from beginning to end. The obstacles that must be overcome by all the parties at times seem insurmountable. Weir puts into practice the question: What\xe2\x80\x99s the worst thing that could happen? And then puts it in the story.The major complaint I have about the story is the language. While it\xe2\x80\x99s not pervasive, there is more than I would like.I give the story four stars.'
p2656
aS'The story is good but the use of slang words and especially the prolific use of one word is both repulsive and a poor use of the English language. It adds nothing and only detracts. The author could have done much better. I stopped reading the book because I was overwhelmingly repulsed by the language used.'
p2657
aS"Undoubtedly the worst-written book I've read in years, which is a pity as the premise is interesting and could have led to something interesting. The characters are so stereotyped they read as if they've been plucked from a supermarket shelf, and none of them  show any development throughout the novel, especially Watney himself who just comes across as too smug for words. The writing is juvenile, with attempts to create excitement limited to using more exclamation marks in one novel than I've come across in all my years of reading. I'm just grateful I've finished it, and can forget about it as soon as I've said all this in my book group - which is the only reason I forced myself to finish it."
p2658
aS'The Watney character alone makes the novel worth reading. He manages to never physically encounter anyone, yet is utterly engaging through the vehicle of his journal. The plot shifts back to Earth at times and at first I was pleased and relieved, fearing monotony, but it never happened. As a scientist I saw flaws, but none overly glaring or detracting. Most of the science was excellent.'

p2662
aS'I read several reviews of this book before I bought it and one, in particular, stands out as the most accurate description of the book\'s storyline.  Essentially, this "Martian" is an astronaut who is mistakenly left behind on the planet due to the hasty departure of his crew when a powerful storm arises, endangering the mission and crew. The commander made the decision to leave his body behind when the telemetry equipment in the " Martian\'s" suit relayed incorrect data, suggesting he was dead.  The book is about how this "Robinson Crusoe" overcomes unrelenting obstacles and adversities to stay alive until he is rescued.  Equipment constantly breaks down or fails because it is asked to do things it wasn\'t designed to do. The author does a good of explaining why things fail but after a while it gets kind of boring reading technical, scientific reasons why something crashes and how the "Martian" manages to jerry-rig a solution for whatever the new dilemma is. For me, after one hundred pages or so,the book got boring.. Not a bad read but, because of the structure of the story, you spend too much time inside the "Martian\'s" head as he ponders survival and, hopefully, rescue.'
p2663
aS'This is one of my all time favorite books. Requires being a fan of humor and potentially science, but you will laugh a lot and be on the edge of your seat constantly'
p2664
aS'I really, really tried to like this book.  Unfortunately, it wasn\'t long before I began skipping pages without reading them.  This might have made a great video or two hour TV special but it simply does not work in book form.  First of all, most of the story is told in first person singular.  That means page after page of "I did this..." and "I did that..." followed by "Then I did this and that...".  The story itself repeated the same kind of scenario over and over again.  Our hero needed to solve a problem in order to survive.  OMG!  How could he possibly succeed?  Wait!  He has duct tape and a staple gun!  Problem solved!  Each time the author fills the space between "I have a problem.." and "I solved the problem..." with mind numbingly boring technical dissertations.  The background story about the attempt to rescue our hero was just plain silly.  Not just the technical stuff but also the stuff relating to how people in real life would actually react to the situation and what they, their organizations and governments would be willing to do to save our poor hero.'

p2669
aS"The book was simply awesome! Unfortunately I don't have a better way to put that, but it truly was an amazing novel. Also, it's cool to think that the possibility of having things like this occur in real life is so jaw dropping."
p2670
aS'One of the best I have read in a long time! At last, a book that doesn\'t "dumb it down" like some brainless television documentary.'
p2671
aS"This book puts you right on Mars. It's an incredibly imaginative and innovative work of fiction. At least I think it's a work of fiction -- it was so realistic you almost have to wonder... And I'll say this about Andy Weir -- if I'm ever stuck on a deserted island, or an EMP device goes off wiping out our electricity, that's the guy I'd want next to me."
p2672
aS'A good read although it gets a tiny bit sluggish in places with all the details.  Worth the read'
p2673
aS'This book is to basic science what Asimov\'s "I, Robot" is to basic logic and Gaarder\'s "Sophie\'s World" is to basic philosophy: You\'ll get some fun lessons in basic physics, chemistry, biology, math and technology.Don\'t let the small percentage of critics scare you away from this book, telling you it\'s "hard sci-fi" more suitable for engineers, techies and nerds. All of the science is at a basic level and it\'s nicely embedded within the adventure/survival narrative. That said, there IS a lot of basic science, so if you are completely bored with science, then and only then I might suggest that this story would bore you.I recommend this book for middle school and high school kids - for some kids it might even inspire an interest in science they didn\'t have before. (I have a niece who got interested in science from watching "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.") However, I will warn parents that this book does contain a few f-bombs. Astronauts can say the darndest things when faced with life-and-death scenarios. Thankfully the profanity is few and far between and there\'s no sex to speak of. Kids reading this book might even get some ideas for school science projects.Likewise, don\'t let critics scare you away with talk of poor character development and clunky dialogue. It\'s all nonsense. For a science/adventure/survival story, the character development and dialogue are appropriate and natural. Some folks seem to expect "Middlemarch." Others grouse that this is MacGyver on Mars, with one problem-solving episode after another. I won\'t deny that problems are solved, but there\'s a difference: MacGyver\'s solutions are largely gimmicky, where he created complex Rube Goldberg devices in a few short minutes, while our hero on Mars, Watney, works with more realistic materials in more realistic timeframes. And unlike MacGyver, the only bad guy Watney has to fight is Mars."The Martian" is basic science wrapped up in an adventure story. Just like Asimov made logic fun and Gaarder made philosophy fun, Weir has made science fun. The people who don\'t like this book don\'t like science, but they don\'t want to admit that. Don\'t let them talk you out of giving this book a chance. There\'s nothing wrong with not liking science, but give it a chance. And don\'t expect "Middlemarch."'

Fast paced(which is great when you have a hard time staying awake while reading at 3am but want to cause this book is awesome!), fun and hard to put down. It's the story I hope to never hear when we decide to put a human on another planet, but there's no achievement in space without risk in one way or another. Thank you Andy Weir, from every geek and sci-fi buff out there."
p2676
aS'While I enjoyed reading the book I am a person who is always turned off by vulgarity in the arts. The "Annie" charactor turned me off completely because she could not utter a sentance without saying "F--K" in one form or other. I realize the purpose is to show the frustration with the situation but for many years authors have managed to do so without the vulgarity. Are today\'s writers so out of command of the English language that they cannot express situations without it, or have today\'s readers lost so much standards that they will not read anything without it. That said, I did enjoy reading most of the book and am glad I did. I would recommend it to sci-fi fans and anyone interested in how a situation like being stranded on Mars would work out. The books scenerio may well come to life before the middle of this century. I don\'t know why it became a best seller really, but can well understand why it is being made into a movie.'
p2677
aS"I am sure everything has already been said about this book, so I will just say for me it wasn't a page turner, but it was a compelling and entertaining read.  I often start books and then lose interest these days, so if a book manages to hold my attention, it is probably a pretty darned good book."

aS"\xe2\x80\x8bI finished The Martian by Andy Weir this weekend and I have to say, damn, that's a good book! I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. The main character, Mark Watney was charming, intelligent, witty, and a bit vulgar. But, hey, he's the only human on Mars and facing almost certain death, so, if he wants to cuss a bit, I'm good with it.The story is hardcore science fiction. There was talk of titration, creating water from hydrogen and oxygen, and lots of mathematical calculations. As a person with a background in physics, chemistry, and mathematics, I loved the science in the book because it had a level of authenticity that you just don't see in many mainstream stories. Heck, I am half wanting to check the news to see how Mark's rescue progress is comingHowever, it was not over the top on the science. Mark's character had enough levity and humor in the face of such a daunting tasks that you really wanted to see him succeed. And the technical details were often explained so that you would understand what was happening even if you did not have a chemistry degree.The story is set in the near future and a 6 person team is sent to explore Mars for a short duration of just over 30 days. However, once on the surface, a dust storm on the 6th day threatens to damage their return craft and they are ordered to evacuate. Unfortunately for Mark, he is hit with flying debris and the rest of the crew believes he is dead. With time running out and visibility too poor to find his body, they launch, leaving him behind.As you might have guessed, Mark was not killed. When he awakens, the launch vehicle is gone and the main communication dish is missing, leaving him unable to communicate with the orbiter or Earth. He knows there will be another manned mission to Mars in about 4 years, but that site is several thousand kilometers away and so he has to find a way to survive with the meager resources he has as well as traverse the Martian surface to the other landing site.The story covers his various attempts at survival and the catastrophes that befall him as he tries to stretch the equipment designed to last for a limited amount of time out to a point where rescue might be possible. All the while, he is giving us his commentary on everything happening to him. I give it a solid 5 out of 5 stars. It is a must read if you love hardcore sci-fi.Now I have to wait a couple weeks for the movie and hope that it is done with as much attention to detail."
p2680
aS'I would recommend'

p2683
aS"A believable and gripping story about possible future events. I couldn't put it down. What you'd normally call a page turner, but being an ebook I suppose you'd have to call it a button presser. If you're into true science fiction without a hint of fantasy or the appearance of any space cowboys, then I highly recommend this book."
p2684
aS"I found this to be an extremely gripping story.  Our astronaut's attempts to modify his environment, to survive in inhospitable conditions, and his struggles to overcome the disasters that threatened to kill him more than once gave The Martian a compelling and heart-stopping tale to life on Mars."

p2687
aS"From the first page this story grabbed my attention, and kept me on the edge of my seat. The detailed descriptions of a near future Mars mission, and one astronaut's quest to survive after being left behind for dead, makes the story plausible. The hero keeps his sense of humour which occasionally relieves the tension that permeates the story. Highly  recommended for both geeks and non-sci-fi fans alike."
p2688
aS"The writing is great, it reads easily and smoothly. Mostly the book is voiced by the main protagonist, but as the story progresses other voices join in, or an occasional third person view is taken. All in all it's a very easy and entertaining read that took me less than 24 hours (mostly because I couldn't bare to put it aside)."

aS"Astronaut Mark Watney wakes up and finds himself injured and alone on Mars. His crew mates believed him dead, so they were forced to leave him behind. Faced with impossible circumstances and utterly alone, Mark Watney refuses to give up. His quick thinking and smarts help him to devise a plan to try and get rescued. Unfortunately, the odds are insurmountable. Watney faces starvation, a hostile environment, and he has no way to contact NASA. Can some duct tape and ingenuity help him find a way home?What I Liked:*I am an eclectic reader, but I can honestly say, I wouldn't likely have picked up The Martian on my own, and I would have totally missed out. This is a sci-fi book packed full of math and science and danger, and I absolutely loved it. This book was so fun to listen to. I was rooting for the hapless Mark Watney, and I completely fell in love with his never say die attitude and his unwavering sense of humor. Think of this book as MacGyver stranded on Mars. Yes, even on Mars, duct tape is miraculous. Trust me, even if sci-fi is outside your normal reading zone, you should read this. It is so good that a movie is in the works starring Matt Damon!*Mark Watney is the star of the show. You would think reading an entire book surrounding one guy stranded alone on Mars would be boring, but nope, it's not. What makes this book shine is Watney's humor. He is always cracking jokes and making sarcastic remarks that help liven up some of the more dry science passages(ninja pirates). I absolutely adored is comedic remarks, his commentary on seventies tv and music was hilarious. Most of the book is told via Watney's blog entries where he relates his Martian antics and failures via a computer journal in hopes that someone someday will be able to retrieve it because he realizes his situation is rather dire. Yet he refuses to give up. Talk about resourceful. Time and time again, he manages to figure out a solution using math and his smarts. Watney actually proves how valuable those algebra story problems can be. Loved, loved, loved, Mark Watney. Geeky botanist or not, he is totally hot.*After a certain point, the book switches view points and you start getting voices from people down on Earth who are desperate to find a way to save Watney. I enjoyed getting inside the heads of the powers that be at NASA and learning about all the obstacles and red tape that had to be dealt with in order to try and save Watney. Eventually, you even get the view points of his former crew mates. I thought the way this story was executed was brilliant, and I thoroughly enjoyed all the view points.*Let's talk about the science parts. This is an incredibly realistic and obviously well researched book. The author takes us through all the science in what is necessary to survive on Mars. You learn about all kinds of fascinating stuff. There are lots of passages where Watney explains the science behind whatever he is doing, whether it be trying to make water or rocket fuel, or even growing potatoes. I know some of you are worried that reading all the scientific details would get a bit dry, but for the most part, it was awesome, thanks to Watney's fun narratives. Watney spices it up, and makes you laugh as he explains things. So even if you don't like sci-fi books with lots of science, you will enjoy this one thanks to the humor.*I kid you not, this is truly an edge of your seat thriller. Watney's life is constantly on the line as he tries to survive one harrowing experience after another. He faces insurmountable odds as he battles starvation, shelter issues, a long arduous journey across Mars to hopefully be rescued, dust storms, explosions, etc. It is literally one mishap after another, and the reader quickly learns early on if it can go wrong, it more than likely will. This is an addictive read/listen that you won't be able to put down as you just have to know if he will survive from one predicament to the next, and most of all, if he will actually get off Mars, because trust me when I tell you, the odds are stacked against him like you wouldn't believe.*This is a book where I absolutely can't recommend the audiobook enough. R. C. Bray brilliantly narrates this one, and he brings Mark Watney to life. He is outstanding. This is the first time I have listened to this narrator and it won't be my last. He vaults his way up there next to Will Patton and Luke Daniels on my favorite male narrator list. I think this one is better to listen to vs. reading, as Bray manages to make all those scientific passages funny. I don't think I would have been as engaged if I had read it vs. listening. If you can, get your hands on the audio.And The Not So Much:*Without giving away too much, I was left at the end wanting more. I would have loved to see it extend just a little bit.*For the most part, I enjoyed all the scientific jargon and the explanations. Weir manages to deliver it in a way where it is relatively easy to understand, but I do admit, there were a few times, especially toward the end when I was overly anxious, that some of it went a bit over my head and I had to listen again. Still I loved all the detail, the science and the explanations. If you are a detail reader and you love science, you cannot miss this one.The Martian is without a doubt going to end up on my best of 2015 list. This is a book I would likely not have picked up on my own, but thanks to all the stellar reviews, I grabbed it, and I am certainly glad I did. This was a fabulous listen, and I cannot recommend the audiobook enough. This is a brilliant book full of science, danger, life and death situations and,believe it or not, humor. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this before the movie comes out. You do not want to miss this book! Outstanding!I borrowed a copy of this book from the library. All opinions are my own, and I was not compensated for this review.Posted@Rainy Day Ramblings."

aS'Excellent writing. The story makes science shine as a means of saving lives. I hope it has wide distribution and lots of influence.'
p2693
aS'This book is terrible.  The sarcastic, jokey tone of the diary-style narrative was poorly written, grating and off putting.  The main character came across as a teenager rather than someone who was apparently intelligent and capable enought to be chosen by NASA for a Mars mission. I quickly started hoping the main character would just die already.  After various miraculous turn of events where it looked like he would unfortunately make it out alive I just stopped reading.'
p2694
aS'I had to get used to the rather goofy behavior of Watley at the beginning of the novel. It almost put me off enough to quit reading the book, but I am very glad that I did not. You soon realize that this is just his defense mechanism for dealing with the incredible difficulties of surviving on Mars. All of his survival techniques and the ensuing trouble that resulted from his failures allowed me to see him as a realistic hero in a somewhat unreal scenario. This is a fairly quick read and worth every minute because it takes so few minutes off.'
p2695
aS"The trials and obstacles that astronaut Mark Watney faces as a lone survivor of an aborted mission on Mars are deep.  He becomes a man solely faced with two options; either expire and give up, or fight.And Fight he does.  This epic struggle in a foreign atmosphere tests all limits of this character's ability. The buzz on Planet Earth as Mark Watney struggles to survive is globally unifying.  The complexity of physical factors (thrust, velocity, speed, mass, atmospheric pressure, etc) are broken down and explained by Andy Weir so that anyone above a high school reading level can understand.Truly, a unique work.  Will be around for a long, long time.  This novel will absolutely be shaping the minds of a future generation of space travelers in the USA, and around the world, as these agencies encounter the obstacles associated with space exploration and discovery that will eventually become as much a part of the future generations of earthlings as the internet."
p2696
aS"Overall I found the book interesting, but unless you're an engineer the Scientific information and technological notes read like a tech manual.  Most the book is taken up with technical detail after technical detail, they're all very believable, very plausible, and I'm sure quite true fact, but,  I would've liked to have seen the main character have more depth, and learn more about him and his personal feelings and life . I will be curious to see how they  adapt it  to the big screen."
p2697
aS'This is my favorite type of science fiction. I think many would consider it "hard" sci-fi to distinguish it from more fanciful stories. You won\'t find bizarre creatures or cultures. Actually, some might find Weir\'s NASA culture bizarre, but it\'s believable. This story is set in the near future and Weir does a beautiful job making it feel as if it could happen now. The characters are people I\'d like to know. The suspenseful scenes are plausible. But wait, there\'s more--Weir has a great sense of humor.'
p2698
aS'Very good well written.'
p2699
aS"Weir does a fine job with this book. As a reader, I loved the plot development and the character development for Mark Watney. I also very much enjoyed the candid writing style - very contemporary, veryunaffected. It fit the plotline considering that Watney, the main character, is stranded on Mars and looking at what seems inevitable death. The technical rendering, and the attention to detail showing how Watney improvised and engineered the basics of survival was fascinating - although, it dragged on a little for my taste. But then again, in defense of the story, it was terribly realistic and the author does a great job of making one live the desolation and sheer solitude that Watney endures. And I was happy to see the unexpected alliance - I won't spoil the read with a spoiler - but politically speaking, it was a perfect inclusion in the plotline. A good read."

aS"This isn't a bad book. At the same time, it's not as good as the reviews would lead you to believe. For me the largest disconnect in the book was the profanity. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with profanity. To me the problem was the level of it used in the book, especially by the main character. I'm not saying that scientists don't cuss. I'm not saying that smart people don't cuss. But they don't cuss this much."
p2702
aS"While not my favorite book of all time, this was a very enjoyable read, and I was truly sad when I had finished the book.  If you loved the Robert Zubrin books on Mars Direct, this is a modern take on Mars Direct in the form of a first person story.  It's a little dumbed down for a wider audience, but it's the classic story of engineers trying to solve impossible problems with what they have on hand.  I think any lovers of hard sci-fi will enjoy this book."
p2703
aS'The book has an exciting premise, and I, like many people were drawn in on the Space theme. I love Space, Mars, Planets, Astronomy, you get it... But what struck me about "The Martian" was that more than half way through the book, the protagonist was still cracking wise-jokes and solving complex problems on his first attempt as if he had only been stranded for a day or two.At no point in the book do you get the impression that Mark Whatney is losing hope, or fearing the reality that he will die on Mars. It all is just one big, happy, sunny day throughout "The Martian" and by the end of the book you just do not believe any of it anymore.'
p2704
aS"I wish I could give this book a negative star. It is boring beyond belief . It is about a office clown character of an astronaut who gets left out on a failed Mars mission. He stays back on Mars while his mates fly off to Earth.  The next mission will arrive in Mars after 4 years. So he figures out ways to survive till that time. Combing Mars soil, some earth soil ( he is, conveniently, a biologist )  and human excreta  he plans to grow potatoes so that he gets sufficient calories to sustain himself  for his lonely sojourn.  There is a huge rigmarole about how he creates water to feed the potato crop. He uses fuel from an abandoned Mars vehicle and combines it with Oxygen from his tanks to produce water. The narrative, then, shifts to NASA control center on Earth. There is somebody called Venkat Kapoor who is some sort of a coordinator for the mission.It is so hilarious, it is obvious that the writer knows nothing about Indian names. The name  Venkat is South Indian , while the surname is Punjabi!!! I mean, whatever!!!The book is barely readable. It has a premise similar to the movie Europa Report, but fails miserably to create a picture of hopelessness and fear in readers' mind.  The protagonist keeps on wise-cracking. I felt he was either mad or smoking something organic and illegal.POOR POOR POORTotal waste of Money and time.Where did the positive reviews come from?"
p2705
aS'Much of the story kept me in stitches.  There was so much humor laced throughout the tragedy of the situation. I was disappointed in the ending though. It was wrapped up too fast after so many pages of descriptive explanations and processes. I expected there to be an epilogue explaining where things went (maybe 5 years) after the ending we actually did get.'
p2706
aS'a very good read, sci-fi light.'
p2707
aS'The process of survival was very interesting. Could not put the book down!'
p2708
aS"The only downside to this novel is that it's the author's only one. I have read it 3 times since purchasing it 2 weeks ago. Amazing!"
p2709
aS"Holy cow! This is the best book I've read in a while and is definitely in the top of my favorite books ever list. Phenomenal... so realistic and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Congrats, Mr. Weir. You've made a fan of me!"
p2710
aS'I found this a great read, fun and not too heavy, but with enough science to keep me interested.  Kept me up at night, just to see what happens next.'
p2711
aS"If reading a chemical engineering major's lab journal is your type of thing, this book is for you.  It's just 350+ pages of a guy narrating his lab experiments.  Very boring, little action, predictable, overly-rushed ending, and anti-climatic.I'm pretty sure people read this book just so they can pretend they understand it in hopes of feeling like they are actually intelligent."
p2712
aS'I think the style of writing is terrible, reads like an 8th grade creative writing assignment.Pretty much reads like this, over and over.Day 1Oh **** I\'m gonna die because I don\'t have "X"Day 2I figured out how to get "X", but it\'s really dangerous and I might dieDay 3OK, everything worked out (insert terrible attempt at humor here)'
p2713
aS'The protagonist, Mark Watney, is a mechanical engineer-cum-botanist who gets stranded on Mars, and needs to travel a long distance to reach a place where he can be rescued.This is science fiction in the strict sense of the word. No monsters, no aliens, no space-wars. Just a fanciful tale made plausible by nuts-and-bolts scientific explanation. But the real prize is the character of Watney himself, who always handles adversity with courage and ingenuity. His cheerfulness and "never-give-up" spirit is inspirational.  A real page-turner and a great read.'
p2714
aS'Awesome book. I enjoy reading it. And I saw the movie. Both versions are the best.'
p2715
aS'Lots of scientific stuff and humor amid a desolate and seemingly hopeless situation.  I would have liked more insight into the main character.  He seemed a bit two-dimensional, especially, when there was so much time to think, the author could have a dug a little deeper into his psyche.  Otherwise, entertaining (yay!).'
p2716
aS'What on earth could anyone find interesting about this "novel?"  The writing is utterly childish with profanities liberally sprinkled about in order to make it seem grown up.  I\'m not saying this because I\'m offended by cursing, but it is so blatantly obvious what the purpose of it is here.Do yourself a favor and give this book a pass. I cannot believe that anything so utterly shoddy could be the basis for a movie, or maybe it can.The science, at least in the couple dozen pages I endured, is not particularly accurate. Others have critiqued it, so I won\'t.  Give this drivel a pass, then pick up something, anything by a better author. It won\'t be hard to do.'
p2717
aS'I read this book from start to finish in one day simply because it was too engaging to put down and read later. As an avid reader of many literary styles including sci-fi I very much enjoyed this story from various levels. With a background in Geology and having studied Mars as a graduate student I followed this story from the perspective as a reader as well as one familiar with the terrain Mark, the storyteller, dealt with on his way to being rescued.I would not hesitate to recommend this book to my fellow teachers as well as their students - high school and above. In fact I can see a literature unit using this book along with the many online resources about Mars to track his journeys on Mars.And for 99 cents this book was very well worth it.'
p2718
aS'There were more numbers in the book than there were words.'
p2719
aS"A real pager turner...Mark did a great job...can't wait to see the movie."
p2720
aS'but a great premise and an easy read, I really enjoyed it. Sounds plausible even possible ... lots of good humor.'
p2721
aS'I loved this book. It was very suspenseful. The only objection I gave, is it gets a little heavy-handed with the author piling on disaster after disaster soap opera style.'
p2722
aS'A great story line is marred by disgusting profanity. I am ex-navy and have a thick skin, but find the profanity repugnant. I didnot complete the book. If the author just left out the bad words the book would be excellent.'
p2723
aS"I was looking for something new to read and Amazon recommended this on my Kindle phone app. I took a chance, and am I glad I did! It's hard to believe that the story of an astronaut stranded on Mars would be hilarious, but the author has a way with words that make even the struggle to survive funny. There's enough science in the story to keep it grounded and realistic, while the reactions to setbacks and successes on the part of the stranded astronaut make for extremely entertaining reading enjoyment. I recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor, and I can't wait for the movie to come out. Just don't get Justin Bieber to play the lead, OK?"
p2724
aS"The hype is real for this book. If you like science fiction and you like humor, you will like this book. You can finish The Martian in a few days, or one long session if you've got the time.If you haven't heard, the book tells the story of Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut accidentally left behind on Mars. How he survives, or doesn't, will keep you reading.MINOR SPOILERS BELOW (really minor, but just in case)The book isn't perfect, partially because our understanding of Mars has changed since it was written, but also because the author leaves some plot holes and questions unanswered. One, for example, why doesn't he try to increase the speed of the rover? There are a few others, but it doesn't kill the story. You probably won't even think of them until you're done reading.Pick it up, you'll be happy."
p2725
aS'Awesome page turner. Read it in one sitting.'
p2726
aS"Funny, scary, suspenseful, and nerdy. Wait, what? Yup, a nerd book can be all of the the above. An excellent, relatively fast read (if you take Weir at his word about the science stuff and do a little skimming). Only downside was that the minor/supporting characters weren't very well developed. Weir would have been better served eliminating them almost completely to focus on the main character."
p2727
aS'Outstanding! I have the scientific aptitude and interest of a handicapped rock, however I was hooked beginning to end. Only regret is I finished in 3 days....'
p2728
aS"Being a science enthusiast, I enjoyed the realism of the story's plot.  If you have seen and enjoyed the movie, I'd suggest reading the book, as it goes into greater detail of the plot and contains much more great humorous dialog."
p2729
aS'so so'
p2730
aS'Amazing book. Very glad I purchased it after a friend recommended it. It lives up to the hype.'
p2731
aS"Amazing story!  Don't be fooled by the title.  A smart, engaging page turner."
p2732
aS"nomally I don't read sy fi books but this one is a winner"
p2733
aS'There is a lot of technical detail describing the challenges of surviving when abandoned with limited resources on a far away planet that does not support organic life. The main character is well fleshed out, and the supporting characters back on earth and in inter-planetary vehicles are sufficiently developed.  The plot could easily be modified into a successful movie.  Stick with it through the first 60 - 80 pages and you will really enjoy it. In the first part, the main character has no way to contact earth. But he figures out a way to survive and a solution to the communications issues, and from there it is quite compelling.  With the right group of people putting it together, it would make a great film.'
p2734
aS'great book'
p2735
aS"This is a great book.  It has been awhile since one has pulled me in like this one did.  It gets very science technical at times, but get thru  them it's worth it."
p2736
aS'Mark Whatney is one of six astronauts on the third manned mission to Mars. When a violent windstorm arises and they are forced to abort the mission, Whatney is struck by a loose satellite dish and presumed dead. But he isn\'t, and the crew leaves him behind on Mars in ignorance. He is then forced to assess his situation and do everything he can to survive until he can alert NASA and formulate a rescue plan.I loved this book! The story is plausible and based heavily on science, but it is a presented in a way that a layman can understand and become invested in. Although I believed I could guess the ending, I couldn\'t wait to find out what was going to happen. I read late into the night and carry the book around the house with me in case I could sneak in a few pages while cooking dinner or during commercials when I watched TV. The short snippets made this very easy to do. Aside from the exciting story, this story is great because of the characters. Weir\'s diverse cast of characters are excellent and memorable, especially Whatney who gets so many great lines, I can\'t even quote them all. I got one of the biggest chuckles from this one: "If ruining the only religious icon I have leaves me vulnerable to Martian vampires, I\'ll have to risk it."I cannot recommend this one highly enough. Sci-fi geeks and casual readers alike will find it hard to put down.'
p2737
aS"I think it's the greatest book of 2014! The author begin this book with an intense and deep emotional situation. Mark, an astronaut, gets lost from his crew during a dust storm on Mars. While his crew think he is dead, he fights to keep himself alive. Each chapter is a deadly trouble which Mark should solve, with little tools and resources. Even almost dying every day, he keeps in a good mood, always making jokes with his condition or being a smart ass. The entire book is a emotional roller coaster trip."
p2738
aS'The word "unputdownable" is too often thrown around when describing books.  This book is pretty unputdownable.  I\'m giving it four stars because I agree with a lot of the criticism that the characters are one-dimensional, and the main characters humor does become,... not "tedious," but more and more unrealistic, as I\'d imagine that the stresses of space travel, coupled with the endless stresses he encounters, would eventually put a dent in this man\'s "armor."This isn\'t "Life of Pi in Space."  I loved that book too, but this book doesn\'t have long reflections on life and philosophy.  The Sun isn\'t for Martian sunsets, it\'s for precious solar power.  What this book does have is wonderful details of all the equipment and parameters of a very plausible and informed Mars Mission given to us in an exciting survival story.  Really it\'s like sitting in on a great science presentation given by a funny and gifted teacher.If you think an episode of McGuyver is too boring and overly scientific, then you probably will hate this book.  Otherwise, I don\'t know what people could mean by saying it\'s "technical."  If you understand a little about air, gravity, food, and energy, you pretty much have all you need.  Also maybe what H2O and CO2 are, and what they are made of, although I think he explains it very well in a succinct and entertaining way.'
p2739
aS'Looking forward to seeing Movie perhaps even tonight.'
p2740
aS'Too technical'
p2741
aS"Fantastic!  Inventive! Even if you've seen the movie, you have to read the book - for the rest of the story."
p2742
aS"I'm an SF lover, and I've read quite a bit of it, but this just blew me away. The combination of hard science, engineering, and writing style made an incredible page-turner. Can't wait for the movie!"
p2743
aS"Yeah... I definitely expected way more of these book and now I am actually looking for the movie and expecting it to be better than the book. Why? Well first, while the reading is fun, it is a bit too technical. If you are not into it, I am pretty sure you can skip it and honestly, it doesn't make any difference for the story. Second, it is totally predictable and it is a pretty obvious formula: 1) problem 2) think 'now I'll be dead' 3) find a solution 4) character is happy with the solution and then... the cycle repeats! And so it goes for the entire book.The character is completed undeveloped. No psychological conflicts, no existential doubts, no lack of faith, no anger. He is so positive all the time and accepts so easily his fate, that it just feels unreal (I know this is fiction. But c'mon.) So that's why I hope the movie will be better. They actually might develop the main character.Overall: It is a fun read, but not amazing and far from being a top read. Don't buy it, get it at your local public library."

p2749
aS'"The Martian: A Novel"Yeah, this thing is a "novel", just like Brett Easton Ellis\' American Psycho was a "novel".PLEASE do not take seriously any of the claims that this is hard SF at its best. By that logic, the greats of the sub-genre would include complex wiring diagrams of industrial machinery.So glad I got this from the library instead of wasting my money on it. Back to reading Stanislaw Lem.'
p2750
aS"Couldn't put this down. A testament to the ingenuity and tenacity of humankind.  I felt like I was right beside the main character the entire time."
p2751
aS"This book definitely deserves a 5/5. A great survival story with a memorable character. Can't wait to read other books of Andy Weir."
p2752
aS"I am an SF fan, and based on the buzz about how good this book was supposed to be, I looked forward to reading it.  However, the writing is crude and the attitude of the protagonist was such that I had no interest in finding out what happened to him.  Very disappointed.  This is one of the few books I didn't finish reading.  I just didn't want to waste any more of my time on this book."
p2753
aS"This was a random purchase and download that knocked me out of my chair. I read it virtual cover to cover in 2 days and couldn't get my iPhone Kindle reader out of my hand. I especially appreciated the detailed and science-based explanations that didn't gloss over why the protagonist made this decision of why this disaster occurred. I'm not a chemist, a botanist or a astrophysicist but it all seemed very realistic and genuine. Would recommend to anyone including the die-hard science fiction nut which I am not. Great job"
p2754
aS'This story blew me away!  If you love "hard science fiction" like I do, you will love this book.I dislike stories that have a plot that could be set in the Stone Age, in Medieval Times, the Wild West or the future.  Sure they have their place but when I want to read Science Fiction I wand to read Science Fiction. I love science fiction stories that could not fit into any other setting.I have been disappointed many times by so called science fiction stories that deal with fantastic, promising settings like for instance orbiting space habitats, or humans trying to settle newly discovered planets.  But they always deteriorate to the common human problems that we are so familiar with, greed, lust for dominance and all the base human emotions and faults.  This is very sad when settling a new planet brings so many challenges by itself.  Humans will pull together on one string to survive.  There is no need for an antagonist in a good survival story.What does it take to survive in an alien possibly hostile environment?  Show some human ingenuity against all odds.This book is all that and more.  The author, I\'m sure must at the very least be an active member of the Mars Society [...] if not an engineer or physicist in his own right.  Without pulling out a slide rule all the physics and logic in this book appear to be reasonable and correct.  I never had the impression that something was overlooked or unrealistic.(spoiler alert!)The protagonist, Mark Watney, manages to survive against all odds with the help of his own mind, the NASA crew at JPL and his former ARES 3 crew-mates on the HERMES ship.This is a great read and I am hoping that there is more from this author.'
p2755
aS'Great adventure, survival story!  I loved the convincing science and enjoyed all the characters. I was completely absorbed from beginning to end. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science, sci-fi, survival, adventure and well developed, humorous characters. This story has all the bells  whistles.'
p2756
aS"I thought this book was ok. It was pretty tedious and repetitive though with the extremely detailed technical things going on. Yes, I get it, the main guy is super smart and needs to figure out how to survive.. I really don't need to know why something is or isn't going to work and know every single tiny detail why. I enjoy science, I enjoy reading about it, but again... I don't need to know every detail about it. Sometimes, I just want the cliff notes.In this case... I think the movie is going to give me what I wanted more than the book. More personality... less extremely detailed sciency stuff lol."
p2757
aS"This foul-mouthed immature trash is a complete waste of time and money.  The author apparently has no idea that NASA astronauts are trained to behave in a professional and respectful manner, whether they feel like it or not.  They would never use hundreds and hundreds of obscenities, as if they were crude teen-aged morons.  The book consists of one short, choppy, obscenity-filled sentence after another, page after page after page.  The author can't create a whiff of personality in any of his characters and yet somehow manages to disparage women anyway."
p2758
aS"Whether you have the background to follow the science or not, this book is just flat-out entertaining. Every problem and twist is like nothing I've ever read and the things Mark comes up with to solve them are even more amazing. Cliff hanger every step of the way! I've never read through a book this fast."
p2759
aS"I'm not going to recap the plot or the other reviews but will have to say this was a page turner. Couldn't put it down and found myself creating time to read it. It was a funny and moving book about the human spirit and a good celebration of NASA, scientists and people in general. Amazing that an authors first book can be this good. I would also highly recommend the audiobook which was brilliantly done."

p2764
aS'This is a wonderful book covering the unexpected stranding of an astronaut on Mars. The main character is an every day kinda guy, albeit a very smart one. He could easily be your smart, sassy drinking buddy at the local pub. The problems he finds himself in and the ways he manages to think himself out of trouble makes for great edge of your seat entertainment. The story progresses nicely and the science elements are explained in easy to understand term. When tragedy strikes, you can believe in the situation and steps our protagonist takes to get himself out. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan, this book is a great read.'
p2765
aS"If you like good writing, this book isn't for you. I got through a quarter of it and gave up. I haven't done that in years."
p2766
aS'I usually take 3-4 weeks to read a book, but this book I finished in 2 weeks. I enjoy "fact-based" stores and this appeared to be that kind of book. The story is about 1-mans survival on Mars after his crew leaves him behind thinking he was dead. He is both an engineer and botanist, so he finds ways to survive until he can be rescued - if he can be rescued. Good background story about the mission to Mars and the characters. Enjoyed his thinking and actions that were "out-of-the-box" to survive on Mars.This was an unusual book selection for me, because it was a hybrid between science fiction and fact-based...which most science fiction books are, but this one seemed so real.'
p2767
aS"I read this through in one day. I couldn't put it down. You get so wrapped up in what's going to happen next. Really loved the novel. The science-type stuff is explained in plain terms, and everything is easy enough to follow. Some of the characters aren't as developed as others, but that's the point. They enter and exit the story when the time is right. Besides, it's all about our buddy on Mars."
p2768
aS"A great read. Robinson Crusoe on Mars. The hero's problem-solving abilities are incredible and almost preposterously good, but everything is reality based. I hope Andy Weir applies his skills to other survival topics."
p2769
aS'If you liked the movie Gravity, this one is for you.  I might classify this as Cast Away meets Apollo 13.  (That is, if I wanted to describe it in terms of Tom Hanks movies!)  Very smart and interesting story, while remaining wonderfully full of rich scientific explanations in lay terms.'

How do you survive? What to do about dwindling air supply? Rescue attempts fail. Now what?Mr. Weir has written a real treat. Should have won the Hugo."
p2772
aS'Okay, not in the pantheon of great literature, but I really enjoyed this book. It was a fascinating story, and I have great admiration for all the research that the author had to go through in order for the story to be plausible. I was near tears sometimes with the emotional tension of it all.'
p2773
aS'I have had my reader for over 3 years  this is the first time that I have rated a book. I gave Martian a 1 as it is the lowest choice available. I normally read the preview prior to purchasing a book  generally it gives a very good indication on whether I will like the rest of the book, however this preview does not prepare you for anything about this book. The book is so full of useless commentary  was a complete waste of time, I can not believe that I managed to get thru the entire book.'
p2774
aS"I really enjoyed The Martian. Mark Watney is a likable and smart hero. You just can't help rooting for him. The author keeps the surprises coming, as Watney just solves problems as they pop up. Will be looking for Andy Weir's next novel - soon I hope."
p2775
aS"I was completely over taken by this book.  It held my attention from the first page and I couldn't put it down.  You know it's a good book when days after you finish it's in your thoughts!  Wishing it was still going on. Great read!"
p2776
aS'The same way that the new Sherlock reboots Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes to the present day, Andy Weir\'s "The Martian" reboots Robinson Crusoe (and Caataway, and  ...) to now. Instead of a sailor trapped on an island, we have a hacker -- both physical and computer -- trapped on a planet. It\'s sort of MacGyver Crusoe in Space.Weir\'s book is all sorts of things: Propulsive plot-driven in Crichton style, compulsively analytical, and, dare I say it, funny.Yes, funny.My main criticisms, such as they are, are that the book\'s relentless cataloguing of gas mixtures and duct-taped solutions to problems can become overwhelming, but ... just skip some of that stuff. I did, and the book lost nothing in the skipping. Second, the characters all kind of either blend into one another or are awfully clich\xc3\xa9d -- Can-Do Insouciant Astronauts! NASA Bureacrats! Bookish Geeks With The Solution!.But ... those criticisms are pointless. You know, that\'s not really why you\'re reading this book anyway. You\'re reading it find out of MacGyver successfully ... MacGyves on the big stage Weir sets out for him," Mars, with the world watching .'
p2777
aS"Characterization is nonexistent, the story is formulaic, and the book is just written badly. The author goes into excruciating detail about the science behind space travel and surviving Mars, but apparently forgot that he was writing a novel, which requires an actual story. The main character does not act like a real person, he's trapped on Mars and he never worries, barely mentions his family, and shows very little concern about the fact that he could die, he just space Macguyvers his way out of every situation and cracks stupid jokes. And the humor is stale and juvenile; an example of a recurring joke, the main character only has disco in his Mars camp and he dislikes disco. Ha ha? Since there's going to be a movie of this coming out soon, I suspect this is just a movie pitch that an editor tried to fill out and failed. If you really want to read a book on the science one might use to survive on Mars, this has that in spades, but if you want any kind of decent story, move on to something else."
p2778
aS"I normally read during lunchtime, I couldn't wait to find a quiet spot to sit and get on with this book. Never boring, I grew to love the main character."
p2779
aS"I enjoyed the book and found it to be an interesting story. The only thing that kept me from a higher rating was the profanity...While I'm not against it being used when appropriate, or occasionally, I feel it was used a bit too much. Other than that, I enjoyed the story and I found it entertaining."

p2782
aS"I'll keep this review quick. I found the Martian to be a quick read. The style alternates throughout which keeps the suspense and prevents the story from becoming stale. The book is quite humorous and fun. I wouldn't say it's realistic but then again in order for a story like this to be engaging and fun it is very unlikely that it would be. With that said if you're looking for a fun read that is engaging and includes a good among of problem solving this is a good choice."

aS"Great read! Can't wait to see the movie!"
p2784
aS"I heard about this supposed thriller on Windows Weekly and thought it sounded like a fun read. WRONG! This novel is so bad I have to wonder how any sane person could rate it above one star. No character development whatsoever. No real suspense or edge-of-the-seat action. It's filled with boring survival chapters: how do I make water? how do I make Oxygen? how do I make soil? B-o-r-i-n-g! I began skimming page after page and then whole chapters looking for something to capture my imagination but there was nothing. I'm chucking the book as a total loss and stroking off this writer with his amateurish attempt at producing a novel. Save your money and your time."

Not just because it has a lot of high tech concepts that the writer (and the helping editors, if there are any) somehow managed to elegantly simplify for sci fi fans, but also because the topics it discusses feels nothing short of a well written and presented educational episode of Through The Wormhole or The Universe TV series.So within that interesting and tough to pull-off framework, the writer manages to add a really beautiful compelling story.A story with no cheese and fillers, has very clever thought provoking problem solving moments, and just the right amount of generous dialog pacing filled with smart humor, delicate reader-intellect-respecting conversation pauses, and non-confusing super clear and distinguishable characters in multi-character conversations.It's like one of those art pieces that makes you wonder how they pulled that off.Also, most importantly, it does not have anything that annoys you in any way. It's magically pleasant all through, no annoying characters or situations, just pure triumphant of the mind euphoric moments mixed with very clever elegant humor.P.S. I listened to the novel through audible (not read it in text)."

aS"I was slightly worried about the quality because of the price.  I would have paid a lot more for this book.  It is by far one of my favorite sci-fi books I have read in a long time (and I've read a lot.)  It is very interesting how the protaganist goes about solving one problem after the other using math, physics, etc.  At times very funny as well.  It was very suspenseful at the end and I even had a couple tears at the conclusion.Seriously, this is excellent.  Don't let the price fool you."
p2789
aS'This is the most entertaining scifi book written in decades. Very detailed and as accurate as possible, but with a genuine sense of humor that makes it really engaging and difficult to put down. I went on a vacation in The Bahamas and ended up finishing reading this in the hotel one morning rather than doing beach things.'
p2790
aS'I really enjoyed this one. The detail and science in this book were unusually well done, and the story was excellent. Highly recommended.'

aS'Great read if you are technically inclined, which I am.'
p2792
aS'Fascinating, hard to put down.'
p2793
aS'Loved the book for all the same reasons as everyone else, but my complaint is that the book wasso poorly manufactured that the back cover split from the spine and started coming apart within thetwo days that it took me to read it!  Anyway, I hope someone makes a movie from it.'
p2794
aS"Great book couldn't put it down! Nasa will hate it. Can't wait for the future!!!"
p2795
aS'Great story, ruined by the adolescent need for curse words. This book starts out with the word F***** then continues with the regular use of more, very much unneeded foul language. Authors, when will you learn to write without the silly, ugly, nasty use of foul language? Please, grow up. Learn from Dean Koontz, John Grisham and other professionals (both millionaires) who refuse to go down to that level.'
p2796
aS"This reminded me of the Jr high state test you take at the end of the year with the story and math problems. I stopped reading at 10%, 20%, and finally gave up at  42%. First book I've ever given up on. I'm only rating this because I seen the previews of this book for a movie. Hopefully I can save your time and money."
p2797
aS"Thank goodness I found other people who didn't like this book. I thought I was crazy given all the hype surrounding it. There's no style or flair at all to the writing. The main character is snarky and peurile, sounding like an apathetic, condescending 15 year old. The story is described without any real plot development, just a series of challenges overcome and a lot of science-y talk. This would probably make a good screenplay for a visual effects heavy space adventure movie. As an example of even basic literature it's an utter fail."
p2798
aS'Very compelling and well written.'

aS"All plot.. characters have zero personality.. it's all about problem solving! written by a true computer scientist/programmer~!! Can't wait for the movie to see the actors interpretation of the characters. Two thumbs up! Highly recommend."
p2803
aS'Very boring, yet a movie has just been made from this novel and it is still on the best selling lists, which I swear I cannot understand.  Perhaps the movie will give it the music and the setting and hopefully the acting that the story needs to make this story better than it is.'

aS'Love this book!!'
p2806
aS'This is just an incredible book. Very well written. It had me hanging on the edge of my seat and laughing throughout the book. The science is accurate. Did not notice any editorial errors. I tend to get bored with books but I read this in about a week of leisurely reading. If not for work, I likely would have read it in one sitting. One of the greatest things about this book is that while he is constantly in jeopardy, the problems he faces are often because of solutions to his previous problems. Highly recommend it and cannot wait to see the movie!'
p2807
aS'It was mint ae.Recommend it highly.'
p2808
aS'I read this very quickly because it was so engrossing. Much of the book is basically "How to overcome *this* problem." That sounds like it might get tiresome but it never did. The author did a mea culpa somewhere where he admitted he took artistic license with the storm at the beginning book. Aside from that, everything seemed pretty realistic. (OK, not that I would *know*.) I found myself aghast at a problem he faced and was then impressed when he solved it. (I would\'ve been dead the 1st week.) The author employed humor to great effect throughout the book. I was especially delighted when NASA warned him to be careful what he wrote (he used the F-word) because it was visible throughout the world. He responded by writing: "Look! A set of boobs! -- (.Y.)" Took me awhile to finish laughing over that. I had a great time reading this.'

p2810
aS'Excellent book.'
p2811
aS'I enjoyed this book at first, but eventually the main character\'s "cool nerd" persona got a bit over bearing and made it harder and harder to read. He decides to call units of measurement "pirate-ninjas" or something equally LOLRANDOM and I rolled my eyes so hard they nearly fell out of my head. The actual plot is very compelling. The science is very interesting. But damnit, Mark, being stranded on Mars is no excuse to be a total tool.'

aS'I loved this book. My only complaint was all the scientific verbiage. There was a lot. But it had me on the edge of my seat all the way to the end and I loved the humor.'

p2821
aS'I understand the 5-star reviews  -- but I can only give The Martian 3.To his immense credit, Andy Weir has re-invented Daniel Defoe\'s terrifically popular 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe and turned it into a nerd\'s fantasy of engineering competency. This is a huge achievement, and yet it is flawed.Robinson Crusoe dealt with a shipwrecked sailor\'s survival narrative, and The Martian is likewise at core a survival narrative.  Survival forms the core tension for novels as diverse as Lord of The Flies, Hatchet, The Hunger Games, Flight of The Phoenix, and Jurassic Park.  The varying literary quality can range from young adult (Hatchet) to the serious literary concerns of Lord Of The Flies.In the case of The Martian, Weir invented his own genre (another considerable achievement, maybe worth 5 stars alone.) Call it the uber-engineering problem-solver technology puzzle survival narrative. This structure of creating problems (puzzles) to be solved in order for the hero to survive and then having the hero solve them is gratifying and fun. You hope to God that if you were stranded on Mars, you\'d be as smart as Weir\'s astronaut hero and figure out such crazy, clever inventive solutions. This problem solving structure, a strength of the book - is also a weakness, because 90% of the plot goes like this:1. Astronaut Mark Watney meets technical problem A, solves with clever solution B.2. Astronaut Mark Watney meets technical problem C, solves with clever solution D.3. Astronaut Mark Watney meets technical problem E, solves with clever solution F.4.  REPEAT, REPEAT, REPEATThis novel argues a deep faith in human reason and hard work to solve any problem, and that reveals a na\xc3\xafve core.  Because the book never strays far from the technical details to investigate any of the bigger problems that more serious science fiction might address.(Aside:) I was at a presentation at the Rand corporation where the engineers present demonstrated crazy hubris in their ability to solve global warming. Their attitude: "Don\'t worry, if climate gets really bad we\'ll write some code - that\'s what we do."Still, if you are going to write hard science fiction, it\'s easy to get trapped within the known limits of technology. And one of the things Weir does well is to poke into every corner of the known. I am sure he had fun researching this book, and learning details about the battery that went into the 1997 Pathfinder probe. There are limits to that kind of convincing detail, because while readers want that, they also want to connect with the human factor, and interesting complex characters.Astronaut Mark Watney\'s log feels believably written because his entries are composed like you\'d expect a guy with an engineering degree to write. This is not a slight at guys with engineering degrees (Norman Mailer studied engineering for awhile.) But engineers are typically less interested in stylist prose than cool engineering details. Any lack of style on Weir\'s part actually adds to the credibility of his hero Watney\'s log. And Watney, he is exactly what we have been told astronauts are like: brilliant, cheerful, can-do and tireless. Another writer might have aired Watney\'s depressive doubts or discussed his futile sex life on Mars, but Weir stays in "the clean room." Watney is iconic, a can-do American engineer and farmer. He can even farm Mars, no problem. This book celebrates our belief in that mythic hero, the American astronaut, no doubt a strong part of it\'s appeal. Possibly, if there is an emotional connection and an emotional core to the book it is here. We wish people like American Astronaut Mark Watney existed and if they did we would happily root for their survival. Likely, the readers that love this book are responding to that note.Bottom line, if you are an engineer, you will love this book because it confirms everything about life that ever made you want to be an engineer. But if you are not an engineer, but are just interested in reading the best of imaginative hard science fiction there are better books. Books that engage bigger questions and open worlds of wonder and philosophical inquiry.Here are a few:Rendezvous With Rama (Arthur C. Clarke)Foundation (Isaac Asimov)Ringworld (Larry Niven)Revelation Space (Alastair Reynolds)The Forever War (Joe Haldeman)Spin (Robert Charles Wilson)Contact (Carl Sagan)Downbelow Station (C. J. Cherryh)Red Mars (Kim Stanley Robinson)The Diamond Age (Neal Stephenson)'
p2822
aS'Great!'
p2823
aS'Every night the kids beg to read more of the Martian. Stayed up a little too late on some school nights with this one. Ive been reading out loud so as not to subject them (and me) to the language. Almost a deal breaker. Would wholly recommend if not for the need to edit the unnecessary bad language.A shame that the book is so intriguing, yet my review has to warn about language.Note to author or editor: could you change a few words and make this a family friendly book?'
p2824
aS"You know, I didn't have very high hopes going into this after a streak of terrible books, but I LOVED this book."
p2825
aS"Horrible.  Written like a bad script for a made-for-tv sci Fi movie of the week.  Clich\xc3\xa9d characters and dialogue.  Obviously written in the hopes of making a movie, just hope the movie isn't as bad."
p2826
aS'This story is so captivating. The stranded astronaut is very funny and creative. I wished the story was even longer. This is a book I hated to finish.'
p2827
aS'Powerful story, amazingly boring characters.Our hero could die on mars for all I care, and actually too much effort is invested in saving him.The technical details throughout the book are just too much.'
p2828
aS'Excellent'
p2829
aS'Very interesting plot. The Science seemed probably a bit fuzzy but the story keeps one on the edge.'
p2830
aS"I loved this novel. I am not a huge scifi fan and havent read a scifi novel in a very long time.  This kept me hooked through every page.  I hated reaching the last page because I enjoyed Mark Watney's character so much.  This was a fantastic book....now I will go see the movie!"
p2831
aS'Way too much technical info about a fictional space travel book. Felt action/story was bogged down by fictional expertise.'
p2832
aS'A very clever Robinson Caruso type novel. Extremely heavy on the science. I eventually found myself skipping all the physics to get on with the tale. (no little green men, though. )'
p2833
aS'Very enjoyable.  A welcome entry into the science fiction realm of books.  A bit of language, so not for the young reader, but otherwise great.'
p2834
aS"Felt that the story unfolding back on earth should have been introduced a bit sooner - also would have liked more background on the main character.  Learned more about the people who weren't on Mars.  The end was a bit unbelievable and a little too tidy."
p2835
aS"This book is littered with profanity.  I was drawn to it thanks to the recommendation of friends, but after reading the first few pages I'm returning it and deleting int from my devices.  It is unfortunate that the author would fill a book that is otherwise lauded with so much unrefined language.  I'm also dissappointed that the reviews I saw on several other sites didn't mention this, so now I'm warning you."
p2836
aS"Started the book and didn't want to put it down."
p2837
aS'Very hard to put down.  Keeps your interest.'

p2839
aS'It was super good.'
p2840
aS"First off, I'm not going to bother writing a lick about the plot. Plenty of others have done that, and so does the book's synopsis. What I will say is this one is worth the read. It's quick and funny. Mark Watney is a compelling character who's easy to follow and root for. Others do suffer from a slight lack of character building, however considering the fact that it's a lone man survival story, it's forgivable. For a few months I had been seeing this book on the shelves at my local Barnes  Noble, and had a few friends reference it, but I decided to put off getting it. I'm sorry I did. The science stuff is pretty spot on too, but I'll let Watney tell you all you need to know about that.Lastly, since the film is coming out in only a couple weeks now, Matt Damon seems like the perfect choice to play Mark."
p2841
aS'This book had me literally laughing out loud through a grand part of it. The humor, the writing, the suspense were all amazing. This novel confirmed that I am indeed a geek as I understood every one of the jokes meant to keep the modern nerd in stitches. There is a lot to offer any reader though. This is one book I highly highly recommend.'
p2842
aS"not the best writing but very good ideas. couldn't put it down."
p2843
aS"I initially downloaded this book due to the hype of the movie coming out.  I mean, astronauts  Matt Damon- can't go wrong!  I t's a policy of mine to always read the book before seeing the movie.  After reading it, I don't know if I CAN see the movie.  Never before have I been so invested in a character, more on the edge of my seat.  The book had me laughing out loud, gasping, frantically reading to see what Mark would do next.  I'm sure the movie is going to be one hell of a ride, too."
p2844
aS'Great journey. Felt very realistic. Mark is a lovable and hilarious character. I was sad when I finished the book!'
p2845
aS'Too much technical and engineering detail--not enough development of the characters--the story was lost in a sea of chemical formulas, math equations and science--really disappointing!'
p2846
aS"Technical and funny.  Great combination.  Can't wait for the movie."
p2847
aS"Great book! Highly recommend it to science fiction and space lovers. I couldn't put the book down and now very excited for the upcoming movie."
p2848
aS'This was a fascinating book that I could not put down. I read the book before seeing the movie and the movie was pretty close. However, the movie missed a whole lot of other things that this man with through. His sense of humor and refusal to just give up was very inspiring. I recommend this book for anyone over the age of 12.'
p2849
aS'Started off pretty excited about this. Then I began to realize the humanity was lacking. Kind of robotic actually, just a dude with a preternatural ability to solve problems. Occasionally he expresses emotion. Other people also occasionally express emotion. Basically it\'s science porn. The ending gives this away; it\'s super anti-climactic. I won\'t give it away, just to say all the problems are solved (one way or another) and then... it\'s just over. No (or very little) reflection on what had happened beyond, "Yay, human beings can solve problems with science!" It just ends. Anyway, my guess is the upcoming movie will backfill in the emotion and meaning that is lacking in the book and tone down the science.'
p2850
aS"Hard Science Fiction meaning real science- a very 'this could really happen' story. I heard Mr Weir on NPR's Science Friday program. Good read!"
p2851
aS'Amazing book!  The nerd in me absolutely loved every second of this!!!!!  Dare I ask...sequel???? Pretty please with cherries on top?'
p2852
aS'Liked this very much.  the day to day processes he goes through in hopes of rescue, as well as the setbacks he runs into are very cool.'
p2853
aS'An epic story of what could happen on a future trip to a distant planet.'
p2854
aS'The story was compelling.  I wouldn\'t have thought that a story that was largely about a scientist puzzling himself out of a life and death situation would hold a person not overly interested in physics, chemistry and the like but it did.  I followed it just fine.  I would have appreciated an epilogue over the abrupt ending.  Unfortunately...to my thinking, any good book is worth reading again.  I would never be interested in rereading this.  Nor would I purchase another book by Andy Weir.  Why?  sigh...  I don\'t enjoy a book that makes such liberal use of taking the Lord\'s name in vain.  I just don\'t.  It\'s like they were trying to underline the silly modern notion that a belief in God is antithetical to anything intelligent or "SCIENCE." Whatever...  I\'m guessing this language will be cleansed from the movie because it just doesn\'t sell tickets.  ...or more than one trial book.'
p2855
aS'Great main character - good dialog and great plot! Not a Sci- Fi reader usually - but loved this nook and hope he writes more! Heard about book from authors appearance on "Press Here" a tech show and was so intrigued had to buy it. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f'
p2856
aS'Great read, hard to put down.'
p2857
aS"The sci-fi survival genre is worse off for the inclusion of this book. Weir turns what could have been a compelling story of human spirit into a boilerplate, infantile slog. The characters are shockingly one-dimensional, the conversations are stilted and awkward, and the narrative is predictable. This book has no depth, and Weir's prose is equally superficial. The most that can be said for it is that his technical descriptions demonstrate research and his own scientific expertise. Unfortunately this is far from enough to make this book good. Comparisons to Arthur C Clarke or Issac Asimov are overblown; for their faults, these authors at least used their stories to explore issues of human consciousness and our place in the cosmos. Weir does not even attempt to explore anything beyond the most cursory aspects of the plot.Weir has written a sad simulacrum of a novel, with characters that will be right at home in a summer blockbuster, prose that reads like bad fan fiction, and pop culture fanservice that betrays his identification with the protagonist and which dates this book to a specific cultural moment, ensuring its passage from memory."
p2858
aS"11% through it and simply gave up. It was like going to a never ending chemistry class. The entire read was one boring McGiver like fact after another. DON'T BOTHER...."
p2859
aS'mmakes me wanna see the movie coming out 2 Oct'
p2860
aS"The author isn't a strong writer (from a technical standpoint), but the story was exciting and engaging enough that some of the under developed characters and dialogue didn't bother me. Sometimes, the science bogs the story down, but right when your eyes start to glaze over, something exciting happens. The climax left me on the edge of my seat, which speaks to how well the author pulled me into the protagonist's situation.  The main character is incredibly likable and easy to root for. And root for him, I did!  Overall, a great ride. I really enjoyed this book. I'm a little sad the journey is over now."
p2861
aS'Never a dull moment.  Very realistic.'
p2862
aS'An entertaining and plausible story, but a little too much cliff-hanger prose.'
p2863
aS'Very believable. Enjoyed this book.'
p2864
aS'Most compelling sci-fi I\'ve read in years! Once started, it was impossible to put down. I found myself completely absorbed by Watney\'s determination to survive, his humor, and his ingenuity. The science was plausible to the point of sometimes wanting to shout, "What are you thinking, Mark?!" Obviously, his plight became real to me. I\'m glad I didn\'t discover Andy Weir\'s websight before \'The Martian\' was in book form: I would have been chewing nails between each chapter release. Thanks to Andy for restoring the pure joy and fascination I felt reading Clarke, Asimov, and Heinlein in my youth. Absolutely great read!'
p2865
aS'I have read most of the one start comments agree with them 99%. It was long and boring and the only good thing I did not pay for it.'

p2869
aS'A great read for sf fans......a little technical, but some good drama'
p2870
aS'Way back when I was in High School and College I LOVED a good science fiction story and this takes me back to the books I used to love.  Good technical adventure with survival on another planet.  The science details are solid and the author has a sense of humor.  For those not into the technical details, this book may not be for you, but I really enjoyed it.'
p2871
aS'Witty and scientific, has the perfect balance of tension, frivolity, and survival. Strongly recommend.'
p2872
aS"Don't start reading this book late at night.  Once u pick it up, it is almost impossible to stop reading.  Weir is wonderfully inventive."
p2873
aS'I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a manual (not a novel) about surviving on Mars. The author is annoying from the very beginning with his nudge nudge, wink wink tone. I should have known when two! of the blurbs on the back mentioned McGuyver (sp) on Mars. If you liked the scene in Apollo 13 where they figured out how to fix something with duct tape this book is for you.'
p2874
aS"I rarely believe the hype for $.99 ebooks, but this looked like a good, interesting premise, so I took the plunge. I'm no physicist or engineer; the whole book could be mathematical BS, but I bought it. It's a good story, kind of quirky, funny in a geeky sort of way, fundamentally believable because the character development is fundamentally believable. And it's a feel-good story completely devoid of bad guys, which is a good diversion in itself."
p2875
aS'After seeing the cover, I was very interested in seeing what the book was actually about. The first Mars chapters that start off the story were pretty interesting, although I could\'ve don\'t without the main character\'s cringey "woohoo" exclamations. The content was fine as well, I didn\'t feel it was too technical or convoluted.The the Earth chapters started. What would\'ve been a great concept for a book went out the window after the story started reading like a high school edgy English class paper. Completely one-dimensional characters, horrible dialogue.. What a shame. This book looked so promising.'
p2876
aS'So far, I haven\'t made it through the first chapter. I don\'t think I will ever make it to the end. And while I\'m sure that Andy Weir is a nice person, I have some hard things to say. The book is sophomoric and reads like the first draft of something banged out for a creative writing class in college. No one talks like this. At least, no one qualified to fly in a frigging space ship to Mars talks like this. "Turns out,..." and "thing is, ..." are the sorts of phrase that office managers use to sound clever. I get the feeling that Andy might have re-read "Have space suit, will travel" and "Foundation" and maybe even "Starship Trooper" before he started in on this.  He seems to be aiming for a sort of \'nouveau noir\' voice. The result is that it pulls me out of the story; I become very conscious of the fact that I am reading words on a page. The year is not 1956. We expect more from Sci-fi than ray-guns and half-baked non-explanations of elementary physics. I\'m half expecting to come across the word "atomics". I would swear that he picked up a special edition of Popular Mechanics entitled "The Race to Mars" and used it as the basis of the book. At this point, I\'m kind of wishing that the antenna had finished the guy off.Robert McKee observed that characterization is not the same thing as character. I don\'t want to read a whole novel about a guy just doing stuff for the sake of doing stuff. I\'ll finish the book, I guess. But if I find out that this dude plays jazz flute, studied ikebana, and was a croupier for a year before entering astronaut training, I am throwing it into the East River.P.S. It is a frightening commentary on the state of our American wit that 93 percent of readers gave this book four stars or higher. Terrifying, that is.'
p2877
aS'First of all, I have to admit that I don\xe2\x80\x99t typically read science fiction, so I have no idea how this book stacks up to others in the genre, and as far as the science-y stuff goes, I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely clueless. But- what I can speak to is how this book captured my attention and made me root for the main character from page one to finish.Mark Watney is a dynamite lead character, and the author did such an amazing job of blending his quick wit, sharp mind, and sarcastic sense of humor on the page. This is a character that you can really relate to, whether or not you completely understand his dire space predicaments or not. The science and chemistry might very well have gone right over my head, but the emotion and the raw humor that Mark uses to cope with the devastating blows he\xe2\x80\x99s dealt came through just fine.This book is fast-paced and intriguing, with an obstacle to overcome nearly every page, and I fell into the rhythm of the narrative pretty quickly. It is at times a really harrowing and tense read, and the last third of the book absolutely flew by for me. I was turning pages really quickly, dying to know how things turn out for Mark and the crew. The pacing is really quite great.I highly recommend this book, even for a reader who isn\xe2\x80\x99t familiar with science fiction. The story is more about the ingenuity of man and the perseverance of the human spirit than the science, and the characters are easy to relate to. It\xe2\x80\x99s an all-around great book.'
p2878
aS"Outstanding book that kept me in suspense throughout. Technically accurate, intelligent, and witty. I didn't want it to end! Top notch read."
p2879
aS"This is a survival story crammed with an incredible amount of remarkably accurate science and ingenuity used by the hero. Yet he remains fallible, his struggle believable,  with  mood swings and wisecracking nature. The twists and turns keep the plot fun. You don't have to be a nerd or even a sci-fi geek to enjoy this book. If you liked the old MacGyver TV show, you will probably like this book a lot."
p2880
aS"Too much time spent on technical physics minutiae. Not much emotional attachment to main character. Can tell it was written to be a movie. Why would he spend so much time updating his damn log? Has a lot of wise cracks for a guy on the brink of death surviving on potatoes and recycled pee. Nobody on earth seems to genuinely care about the guy except for the fact that it's a big news story."
p2881
aS"This is, hands down, one of the books I have read in years. The author was so creative and did such an amazing job to bring this book to life. He made it feel like you were actually right alongside Mark, watching everything happen. The amount of research that went into this book is evident. The character of Mark was absolutely hilarious - I loved his sarcastic humor. Highly recommend this book! I can't wait for the movie!"
p2882
aS'Maybe a great book for a techie but way over my head and not really a story but a detailed account of how to build things out of nothing.'
p2883
aS'I don\'t understand why this book is so popular.  The reader knows how it\'s going to end as soon as they start reading.  Several of the events/items on-board, etc. were ridiculous - like raw potatoes being sent in space to make the crew feel closer to home at Thanksgiving.  Raw potatoes in space?  Seriously?  And why didn\'t this expert botanist get to choose what types of seeds he wanted to experiment on in space?  He was sent up there with a variety of grass seed?  Over and over and over, I found myself thinking "What?! - that\'s just stupid."'

aS"can't help but imagine yourself in his place.  the book makes the movie more enjoyable."
p2886
aS'This book was so well researched it was instantly believable.  It hooked me from beginning to end. I wanted to stand up and cheer at the end.'
p2887
aS"Intense, non stop action. Started this book on a Sunday morning and couldn't put it down. Subsequently I finished that Sunday afternoon. A must read before seeing the movie!!!!"
p2888
aS'Great story. If this was available when I was teaching high school science it would have been required reading except the gratuitous obscenities made that impossible.'
p2889
aS'Far too much gratuitous Anglo Saxon cursing.  Words were the F and S, completely unnecessary.  I doubt Astronauts actually use them, at least routinely especially when being recorded.  The last sequence of such usage was ridiculous.'

aS'Great read! Funny and suspenseful.'
p2891
aS'Great  read now I have to seer the movie and see how they compare'
p2892
aS"Was looking for entertaining fictional survival story.  Problem was it was all science/math problem solving through the whole book.  If your a science geek then you may enjoy it and appreciate it.  The Science/Math may be true or not true but the way the book reads, it is very dry, almost like a real non fiction story where nothing really eventful happened that would be considered entertaining.  Also the humor was really bad and dry as well.Ultimately if you love science/statistics/math calculations and problem solving then you may love this book.  I gave it a 1 star based on my expectations vs what I got.  I want my Sci-fi books to have more interesting story/characterizations.  Perhaps if this was less heavy on technical details and things happened like some alien encounter or something on the planet would of made it a more interesting book for me, but that's not this."
p2893
aS"Lots of science I really tried to read because it gave me appreciation for Mark's cleverness at surviving, but they was so much humor and just plain 'can-do' spirit to live that I was totally engrossed.  I absolutely enjoyed and loved this story.  I have immense respect and interest in the previous NASA heroes, the Apollo missions and I was rooting for Mark Watney all the way."

aS'This book is terrific! Please read it! So much fun! Imagine being stranded on Mars for a year or more without human contact or communications Unreal! So well done.'
p2898

aS'A freak accident leaves Mark Watney, an astronaut/engineer/botanist, stranded on Mars. And it\xe2\x80\x99s four years until the next group of astronauts come to Mars. Mark doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough food or water to make it. The Martian is the story of his survival.Though I don\xe2\x80\x99t usually read sci-fi, I really enjoyed this book! Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because I have sons who are chemists and engineers (Weir nailed what engineers thinks of chemistry!), or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because Weir took an amazing survival saga, added a good dose of dry humor and excellent pacing, and turned it into a story that reaches beyond genre\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a novel I can recommend to anyone who wants a good story told well.The one caveat I have is that this book has a lot of profanity. I understand it at the beginning\xe2\x80\x94when you discover you\xe2\x80\x99re most likely going to die alone on the red planet, swearing is a natural reaction. But eventually, the liberal use of f-bombs began to grate on me.That aside, this was an excellent book. I hope this author writes more novels\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to read them.N.B. I received this book in exchange for an honest review.'
p2900
aS"Enthralling story line of an astronaut trapped on Mars. Using his skills he managed to survive all the problems thrown his way. Whilst Sci-Fi, it was not too far from what could be believed given today's technology.Hard to put down."
p2901
aS'I would recommend this book not only to anyone who loves sci fi, but to anyone who is fascinated with anything having to do with the space program and technology behind it. I found myself reading faster and faster toward the end!'
p2902
aS'If you can picture a book like Robinson Crusoe, staring Macgyver, with a writing team including Janet Evanovich and Albert Einstein, you may come close to The Martian. This book is fun, funny, futuristic, feasible, and just plain fantastic. Finally the truth comes out, engineers are the real Super Heroes.This book is timely considering the refocus of our Apollo space program from exploration to possible colonization. This book is believable because potential real problems are fixed with feasible real solutions implemented by a human who will not accept failure. And last, and maybe most important, this book is just plain fun to read. The blend of character development, humor, and drama makes it one of those books you can hardly wait to pick up and hate to end.Mr. Weir, I am looking forward to your next book. I hope you include Super Hero Mark Watney, engineer.'
p2903
aS"A little overwhelming with engineering jargon but other than that I didn't want to it to end.  Will read Andy edit more often."
p2904
aS"Great and fun reading. Absolutely engaging book! Waiting for more from Andy Weir. At this point, I don't know if I want to see the movie. Maybe I will keep the taste. Will see!"
p2905
aS'A great read!!! Had trouble putting it down!!'
p2906
aS"I would think engineers would love this book.  I felt more like I was reading a textbook.  I skimmed the whole thing and certainly wouldn't recommend this book to a woman."
p2907
aS'Seriously. That would have been the most emotionally moving thing that could have happened in this dry, technical-writing-trying-to-pose-as-fiction bore-fest.  The writing structure and dialog is very technical, dull and formulaic.  There are more benign "oh no it\'s gonna be the end" moments in this than a Clint Eastwood film.  And after about the 4th, it grows completely old.  I found myself skipping through parts of the exceedingly dull, chemistry-laden chapters.  And you know what?  I didn\'t even matter.  Since there is no character development, no insight into who this astronaut is, no philosophical reflections,  you miss very little in the story, just a bunch of chemistry you probably don\'t care about in the first place unless that is your passion.  Plus the voice of Watney, with his sophomoric humor and sarcasm, was very distracting and in-congruent with the situation.  More annoyingly, almost every chapter ends with him making a sarcastic remark. Every. One.Realizing this was turning into a sh*t storm of dull, the author should have switched gears and had the Leather Goddesses of Phobos invade Watney\'s MAV.  Now that would have made for a good story.'
p2908
aS'I don\'t read science fiction but my curiosity was piqued by the many positive comments on Amazon.The style of the book reminded me a little of the movie "The Europa Report" in its emphasis on scientific detail to make the story more credible. I think the book succeeds in attempting to make it realistic as a result of the author\'s vast knowledge and almost obsessive attention to detail.But it is the wise-cracking Mark Watney character, that rounds out the book with his matter-of-fact attitude in the face of the many obstacles that the author puts him through.A delightful book overall, full of tension and suspense, that will find you rooting and fearing for Watney, all through his 500 plus sol journey in the inhospitable red planet he was forced to tame.'
p2909
aS'Badly written.  No character development.  Corny sense of humor.  Easily the worst book I have ever read.  Very disappointing.'
p2910
aS'This book is excellent and I could not put it down. I had it read in one day and next week watched the movie, which was true to the book.'
p2911
aS"It's alright. The premise was interesting but the reading took a few times to absorb. It's complex, maybe too complex. It's not light reading on your way to work. You need to invest a few hours in order to fully appreciate the writing."
p2912
aS'Fantastic book. Story and performance are excellent.'
p2913
aS'Pure science and a great story. No metaphysics, no magic, no unexplained technology. A simple "what would you do if..." story. Left for dead and alone on the fourth planet from the sun. No way back to Earth and no way to communicate with Earth. Limited food, air and water.  If you like your science fiction with a heavy dose of real science, you\'ll truly enjoy this book. A great and fun read.'
p2914
aS"Yawn. If you want to know how to make water or recharge batteries this is your book! The only thing interesting was the 'lone survivor' scenario. It was a paragraph."
p2915
aS'Fantastic read.'
p2916
aS'Loved it'
p2917
aS"Great read. Love the humor. Can't wait to see the movie!"
p2918
aS"This was a real page-turner. I was surprised I enjoyed it so much! I'm more of a fantasy genre person than sci-fi, but this was an amazing read. Even if sci-fi isn't really your thing, go ahead and give it a try. It's excellent! (Now, just gotta wait to see the movie!)"
p2919
aS'A survival book on Mars so to speak.  The author provides enough technical information to seem plausible, or at least plausible enough to work within the story while, simultaneously, creating a believable main character that is funny and you cannot help but root for.  I look forward to many future creations from Andy Weir.'
p2920
aS"I don't read much fiction anymore. I'm reading to learn something these days.  But the story is so enjoyable and packed with so much real life science that it kept me turning the pages.  A great read. Can't wait to the file in Nov."
p2921
aS'I think I pissed my pants near the end.  Amazingly good.'
p2922
aS'Book was recommended to me and I did like it.  Shortly after reading it came out as a movie.  You need to be a little on the technical side to appreciate the entire narrative.  But even if you miss the details it is a good story.  One of those books that you suspect is going to have a happy ending without the need to worry about it, just enjoy the plot as it develops.  Interesting all the way through.  Recommended.'
p2923
aS'Full of nerdy goodness.'
p2924
aS'The combination of dry wit plus engineering explanations make this my favorite novel.  I especially enjoy how he brings in socially challenged NASA engineers (redundant) into the narrative.'
p2925
aS"It's been a while since I've read a book that I simply could not put down - and not because I'm addicted to finishing everything, whether it's a book or a TV series, but because it's just SO damn good. You can see how much thought the author had put in all the science and other details and, honestly, I would love to have a science teacher who could explain all the physics/chemistry/astronomy behind what's going on in this universe.I actually thought that all the details about atomic particles and space fuels would bore me to death or maybe I wouldn't get them at all but they're embedded into the story so well, that they just have to make sense.And the main character is definitely someone I wish I had as a friend - intelligent, witty, positive and at the same time down-to-earth (even when far away from Earth). I so love that guy, I could marry him :).The plot flows very nicely, and throughout the book you keep wondering what else will go wrong and whether the main character will survive this time. It could go either way, really, but you know he at least has to survive until the last few pages - otherwise the story wouldn't make sense, would it?Well... all I can say is that you have to pick up this book and read it BEFORE the movie comes out (but you already know that, don't you?). I couldn't recommend it enough, and - believe me - I'm not one to give away 5-star reviews lightly."

aS'This book was AMAZING!! Humorous, Adventurous, and this side of plausible. A Definite must read.'
p2928
aS'The Martian by Andy Weir is the best hard science fiction I\'ve ever read (disclaimer: I haven\'t read a lot of hard science fiction). Simultaneously hilarious, nail-biting, and heroic while being scientifically accurate (the final print version, at least). And, since it\'s science fiction in the very-near-future, there\'s little-to-no hand-waving; the technology in the book is technology we have and understand today.Most impressively, the plot is not driven by a need to move from one set-piece disaster to another--as is the case with most Man vs Nature stories. Instead, the plot is driven by the science, the probable outcomes that naturally arise from being stranded on Mars, and the direct consequences of previous actions. In other words, at no point during the novel did I have the thought, "And now for the obligatory X!" (A statement I utter with increasing frequency as I read more and more books.) Finally, though both the frame (recording logs to be found later) and through the engaging personality of our hero Matt Damon Mark Watney, Weir manages to keep the book engaging even though it is, at its core, about taking a table full of parts and connecting this thing to this thing (http://xkcd.com/1536/).The characters are a bit thin, and everything ultimately shakes out exactly as you think it will, but it\'s a quite a ride.4 Pathfinders out of 5; would get stranded on the Red Planet again.Originally posted on Forest Azuaron: http://www.forestazuaron.com/2015/reviews/book-reviews/martian-weir/'

aS"The science and math are right on.  Couldn't put it down."
p2930
aS'I enjoyed every page and learned a LOT!'
p2931
aS"I give a novel fifty pages. If it doesn't bring me into the story, I'm outta there. I am putting it down. That is what I did with this one. I suspose if I wanted a survival handbook on how to survive on Mars this would be the one for me. This reads more like a science textbook than a novel. Seems to me that the writer needs to take a class in Storytelling 101. And I so agree with the reviewer who said the writing was flat. This guy is nowhere near as good a storyteller as such writers like Asimov. So my advice is to wait for the movie. You'll be glad you did. Or maybe you won't if the screenwriter tells a story as poorly.Next time I will read more than the first page before buying a book."
p2932
aS"It's midnight \xe2\x80\x93 I just finished the book. I couldn't put it down. I'm going to see the movie tomorrow \xe2\x80\x93 I'm sure it won't be anywhere near as good as the book \xe2\x80\x93 but we'll see."
p2933
aS'The Martian is like a Tom Clancy novel. Real world scenario with heavy science to back the story. Compelling drama that puts you on the surface of mars.'
p2934
aS"I am not a good math person or very strong in science. But I like math and science. I also like science fiction. This book was an absolute joy to read. The main character walks the reader through some very complex math and science (and logistics and other fields) in an understandable and fun way. If it weren't for the cursing, I would recommend this to high school students as a great example of how to use math and science in the real world. Sure, Mars isn't Earth, but you can see how problem solving skills learned in math and science classes can contribute to solving real world problems. What a great read. I highly recommend it!"
p2935
aS'I could not put this book down.  Cover to cover in less than a week.  The book was written on line and vetted by a ton of science.'
p2936
aS'Too technical for me.'
p2937
aS'Boring, boring, like reading an electronic manual.'
p2938
aS'An interesting retelling of the Robinson Crusoe genre. Fast paced, considering the action is mainly focused on just one man fighting a hostile environment. But a good tale, well told.'
p2939
aS'The frequent math calculations put a little too much drag on the plot\'s momentum, so this won\'t be everyone\'s cup of "nothing tea." (To borrow a term from the main character.) But the problems and their solutions are clever and believable.  Best of all, the ending is a well-executed page turner, and should translate to a riveting movie finale.'
p2940
aS"This book is like nothing I've read before. The author has outdone himself with the background research on Mars exploration. I read somewhere that he wrote programs specifically to calculate the orbits maneuvers, well it showed! It is very rare to have read a book that is well thought out, cleaver and with realistic story with so much scientific richness and intricacies. I can not recommend this book enough."
p2941
aS'This was a fun book to read.  I was disappointed when I was done reading it.'
p2942
aS'Not my normal reading  but very good nonetheless. Whitney is quite ingenious, just thought that the ending was a bit abrupt. Wanted more.'
p2943
aS'I cannot wait to see the movie.'
p2944
aS"5 for plot, 0.25 for writing style. Over the top expositional writing (have he really wrote a hard sf book assuming that the reader can't multiply single digit numbers or doesn't know that a solar battery needs well...light? Really?), weakest character development I've read in a long time, completely unrealistic handling of the main character's emotions. Due to all above, the book is dull and really boring at times. There's just no drama. We all know that our cosmic hero will just handle everything no matter how hard would that be with a stoic approach throwing jokes around. Boring...."
p2945
aS'Skipped over some of the technical stuff. But most of the detail mattered and managed to be fast paced even with lots of calculations. Well written and exciting.'
p2946
aS"This is th best fiction book I have ever read.  As an engineer I can appreciate all the detailed science included in the book.  I love the back and forth stories between the main charactor alone on Mars and the personnel trying to help him back on Earth.  Also enjoyable is the order of the stories.  There were a couple of flash back stories that could be appreciated more rather than ready the book in chronilogical order.Great read.  Couldn't put the book down.  Finished it quickly.  Looking for one like it to read next.I typically only read non-fiction.  I just thought that should be taken into consideration when seeing how much I enjoyed this read"

aS"When I was a teenager, I couldn't get enough of science fiction. I loved books by Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Aurthur C Clarke, Jules Verne, and Ray Bradbury. Somewhere along the line, I drifted away from the genre. After reading the Martian, I think I need to return to my roots. What I loved about this book was that it cleverly intertwines science with a modern day Robinson Crusoe plot, which moves along with enough twists and turns to keep the reader engaged. The main character is a genius when it comes to problem solving. He combines humor, drive for survival and his considerable knowledge, to beat the odds with amazing schemes and a fair amount of luck (MacGyver has much to learn!). The author effectively uses the narration tool of a digital log book to reveal the mental discipline and range of emotions experienced by the main character in response to the nearly hopeless situation he finds himself in. A well written and entertaining read."
p2949
aS"Tedium set in fairly soon in the Castaway genre novel set on Mars.  The author presents a survival narrative in excruciating detail that made this reader skip whole sections - actually, you need read only the first and last paragraphs of each section to keep abreast of what was going on.  After a predictable, impossible ending, and a yawn, I gratefully put the book down.  But you know what, I think it'll make a great movie!"
p2950
aS'Great for those interested in anything space related, looking forward to movie adaptation.'
p2951
aS'A great survival story with a smart, funny protagonist and supporting characters. The science details are accurate and not too dry, but judiciously used to build suspense. And some of the lines really will have you laughing out loud.'
p2952
aS'Great read, could not put it down till I was finished'
p2953
aS"I read that Matt Damon is going to play the main character in the movie. So as I read it, I could see him playing the part.I just hope that when they make the movie it does follow the book and isn't ruined like Battlefield Earth and Dune were. I'm just saying....."
p2954
aS'the martian. to much technical unput. dont need to know about about all the mathimatics required to travel to make a good story'
p2955
aS'I highly recommend The Martian. Admittedly, I was scared away at first by the technical jargon. I skimmed some of it early on, but I found that after awhile I started to understand all the equipment and ended up enjoying the geeky engineering details.I stuck with it and was rooting for the hero the whole time. I love how the author moved between first person log entries to third person and life down on Earth. Great stuff.Oh and he started out self-published which is fantastic. Good for Andy Weir. I hope he writes a lot more.'
p2956
aS"I enjoyed the way the book was written, I don't want to tell the story, but I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie and I am glad I did. Fast read, believable story........"
p2957
aS"First let me say this type of story is usually not my cup of tea.  But you can now add me to the other reviewers that are really impressed with this book.  Sure, many 1 star reviews bemoan the fact there is little to no character development.  But this story not only doesn't need it, it's better because of this!(Just my opinion).  It truly is a fish out of water story.Like the Amazon summary tells you, Watney is stranded on Mars by accident.  His crew thinks he's dead, with good reason.  They can't risk everyone else to look for his body.  They must abort and get back to the main ship so they all survive.  Believe me, this all makes sense.  Then Watley has to figure out how to stay alive, by himself with little to no resources, until he may or may not be picked back up.The book starts out with Watney telling his story journal style.  After about 25-30%, this gets a little boring.  Then the author finally goes to NASA and shows how they discover Watley is still alive.  Then the author goes into how NASA, and pretty much the whole world, tries like crazy to rescue this guy.No need to go into any further review.  I say, go into this with the fact that there's lots and lots of nerdy stuff, math stuff, botany stuff and other stuff that you may find boring.  Please skim some, but not much, and continue reading.  You won't be disappointed!  I'm looking forward to the movie."
p2958
aS'Phenomenal story! Loved it from cover to cover! Quite witty and humorous.  I even laughed out loud a few times! :) Highly recommend this book!'
p2959
aS'Very entertaining and fast-paced book, but the author drops the "F-bomb" and other profanities much too frequently.  Liked the story, but hated the profane language.  What are we, 12?  Reminds me of little kids looking up dirty words in the dictionary...'
p2960
aS'Cannot wait to see the film!  Love Mark Watney!'
p2961
aS"The story reads like a typical hollywoodish adventure. However, what's amazing is the amount of thought the author has put in for this entire read to be as logical as it is . The chemistry, material sciences, botany and astrophysics that goes behind this book is mind boggling just for the fact that its the work of one person!Its for that solitary fact that this book is amazing. Its also engaging from a story telling point. But I dont find this story gripping or edge of the seat thrilling. A good book nonetheless!"
p2962
aS"Quite technical and over my head at times but a great story. The author is able to put you into the role of the astronaut and you begin to feel like it's actually you going through all the trials and tribulations. Can't wait to see the movie."
p2963
aS"Thrilling! I couldn't it put it down."
p2964
aS"Within the first few pages you'll be captivated by the saga of Mark on Mars...can't wait for movie this summer"
p2965
aS'I see this book has 2000 + 5 star reviews. They all must be friends and family of Andy Weir (who ever he is by the way, there is no biographical information on this guy anywhere) He probably created a computer program to give the book all of those the reviews. Beyond boring.'
p2966
aS"I felt as if I had been marooned  on Uranus... or someones.  I failed H.S. algebra because I would fall into a coma as my eyes glazed over and i would foam at the mouth because it was  coma inducing. in this novel the  repetitive scientific facts over and over really fried what brain synapses I have left.  reading a box of cereal would've held more interest"
p2967
aS'This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. The content is great especially for a space nut. Such a great book, easy read and one of the best original stories available.'
p2968
aS'I heard about this book on Science Friday. It sounded extremely interesting. I think Andy did a great job. I wanted to add for a first novel, but it was wonderful without that last bit. I liked the first person narration. The plot was GREAT but the best part was the believability of the science and math. Not that I could have followed it all,, the part I could was spot on. I gave 4 stars.'
p2969
aS'Great authenticity and realistic knowledge of space and technology.  Understanding the gear coupled with ingenuity and persistence give such believeability that you feel all the excitement, as if you were actually there!  This is highly recommended for any fan of nasa and our astronauts, just what would really happen.  Buy and read at once!'
p2970
aS'This book had no martians, aiens, or anything cool in it.It lied and I cried, a lot.1/10 Worst book ever.'

aS'Science all the things. Loved bringing the science back to sci-fi!'
p2973
aS'For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated by the planet Mars and by stories about the planet Mars.  Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because the planet is close enough to see with the naked eye or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed that putting humans there is a real possibility, or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just that crazy red surface, the planet Mars has always enchanted me.  Needless to say I\xe2\x80\x99ve read lots of science fiction about the planet and there are quite a few good ones out there, from sci-fi greats like Ben Bova, Greg Bear, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Ray Bradbury.  Now I am now pleased to say that this short list also includes the name Andy Weir.So let me set the scene for you, or better yet let\xe2\x80\x99s hear it from Mark Watney himself:blockquoteII\xe2\x80\x99m stranded on Mars, I have no way to communicate with Hermes or Earth, everyone thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m dead, I\xe2\x80\x99m in a hab designed to last 31 days.  If the oxygenator breaks down I\xe2\x80\x99ll suffocate, If the water reclaimer breaks down I\xe2\x80\x99ll die of thirst, if the hab breaches I\xe2\x80\x99ll just kind of explode, if none of those things happen I\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually run out of food and starve to death./I/blockquoteSounds pretty bleak but there is one bit of good news: even though Mark\xe2\x80\x99s crewmates have already begun the long trip back to Earth, NASA is already aware the Mark is indeed still alive.  They caught sight of him in some photos from a satellite in orbit around the red planet.  Now all they have to do is figure out a way to get in touch with him and then all they have to do is figure a way to rescue him before his air/water/food/hope runs out.  No small task.But the ingenuity of Mark Watney is going to surprise a lot of people, sometimes even he himself.  We get front row seats in the form of Mark\xe2\x80\x99s personal journal as he becomes the first farmer on Mars, makes a long rover trip to pick up some abandoned equipment, finds ways to use his gear that NASA never even thought of, and survives one catastrophe after another.  This is extreme botany and creative engineering gone wild, people.  All of you survivalists out there can eat your hearts out.  Through it all, Mark Watney never gives up even when it would be oh-so-easy to do, and Andy Weir keeps us wondering if Mark will ever make it off that beautifully wretched planet right up to the surprising conclusion.  IbThe Martian/b/I is, quite simply, the finest piece of science fiction I\xe2\x80\x99ve read in quite some time.Andy Weir, an unknown author at the time, wrote IbThe Martian/b/I and was offering it in ebook form for free on his website.  Podium Publishing caught wind of the story and believed in it enough to produce an audio version.  IbThe Martian/b/I became the #1 selling audiobook in Comtemporary Science Fiction on Audible.com and was a runner up for Best Science Fiction Audiobook of 2013.  The audiobook was such a huge hit, Andy Weir and Podium pursued a major publishing deal and a year later Random House released the hard cover edition in 21 countries.  It became a New York Times bestseller in its first week.  Is that the American dream or what?I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you\xe2\x80\x99re a \xe2\x80\x9csurvivalist\xe2\x80\x9d or not, IbThe Martian/b/I is just darn good fiction.  It\xe2\x80\x99s about never giving up hope even when it seems all is lost, it\xe2\x80\x99s about pitching in and helping out when disaster strikes, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the spirit and ingenuity and sheer guts of humans in general.  Author Andy Weir, through the voice of Mark Watney, sums it up nicely when he says I\xe2\x80\x9dEvery human being has a basic instinct to help each other out.\xe2\x80\x9d/I  The next time you feel in despair for the species, read this book and have your faith in humanity restored.Narrator R C Bray was a great match for this book.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really get into this in my review, but Mark Watney is kind of a smart aleck and keeps on cracking jokes no matter how grim his situation gets.  R C Bray voiced his attitude and sense of humor perfectly and had me laughing out loud many times during the reading.  This was my first experience with Bray but I would definitely like to hear more from him.'

Geez, the amount of research that went into this book had to have been a tremendous amount. Not to mention timely. Kudos to Weir! Well done! I would definitely recommend this book!"

aS'Man an mars in a book that is painstakingly real and scientific. Its a really good ideal when you look up all the work that goes into making the Novel as Human and real as possible. Not sure how the film will build off it but so far it can only get better. NASA gets a lot of credit for getting small aspects of itself back in order.'

aS"This book is something I'm going to treasure for years to come. Why? Well, I'm a fan of science fiction, fantasy, and realism, and when I saw this book in person as one of the Top Selling Novel in my local store, I had to get it.Nonetheless, I finished this book in less than an 7 hours. The writing was excellent, the pacing felt natural, and the characters certainly are entertaining. What I didn't expect was how much information was put in the story, and how technical it got at certain points. The unexpected biology, botany, physics, and geology lessons added a lot more entertainment value to this book.If anything, you should get this book. It's a unique story, and it has lot of heart."

aS'Loved the realism of the treatment of setting and characters, some slightly tedious calculations but still fun to see how real scientists and astronauts think... I guess thats why I am not one of them...lol.  Sort of a simple story but told with great attention to detail and straight forwardness, though maybe short on real emotion... clearly written by a "science guy". Worth the read of you are curious what Mars missions could be like or at least what factors into them.Cover art is superb, really fits and does justice to the book.'

aS'This is literally the worst novel I have read in my life.  It\'s as if you are reading the blog of a 12 year old, or a software developer, not sure there is really a difference.  Anyone who writes "booyah" should be banned from publication.  Mr. Weir, please stop writing ASAP.'
p2995
aS'Interesting view of Mars.'
p2996
aS'This was a difficult read but a great story of perseverance and imagination.  I had no idea what any of the technical terms meant but it was fascinating how he was able to get out of impossible situations.  It takes a high level and committed reader to get through this novel.  Definitely not for a fair weather reader.'
p2997
aS'"The Martian" is easily the best book I\'ve read this year. Mixing science and human drama, Mark Watney\'s story is as old as Robinson Crusoe and as new as the discovery of water on Mars. Watney is left behind on the planet when his comrades are forced to take off without him. Over a year from rescue, he relies on dogged determination and scientific knowledge to survive. The book is a love letter to NASA, to science and to human ingenuity and the human spirit. Read this book. You won\'t regret it.'
p2998
aS"Despite the title, I liked this book.  At first I did not want to read it because it sounded futurist, or like science fiction, but I found it to be believable enough.  I won't give the story away, but I had fun learning about space stations and how astronauts function and communicate.  I enjoyed the NASA parts.  The main character is likable and funny.  At times the book seemed to go on just a bit long, but overall I would recommend this book."
p2999
aS"A little drawn out in some of the explanations, such as some of the chemistry performed while on mars. This tended to make the book Boring at times ,however still a good read. If you're into  space exploration this is a book to satisfy your imagination."

p3004
aS'I laughed out loud. I have recommended this book to everyone of my friends to read before the movie comes out.'
p3005
aS'Fresh, new and different. Written in a colloquial modern voice which can be tiring, even annoying. But the premise that a modern "cowboy" or "pioneer" be left behind alone to innovate and be resourceful and self reliant ON MARS is intriguing. And it kept my interest throughout. Admittedly I do enjoy details and specificity but still it was fun despite the absence of authenticity and real emotional inner life. It had more of the tone of a video game. Recommended.'
p3006
aS'Technically this was the book I should be completing at the end of this week. Yet, it only took me two good evenings and a short third to read this book. The reason it was so quick of a read because it was so good. When I can enter into a story and feel what the character is feeling, laugh with the characters, cheer for them, hurt for them and be driven through the suspense of their crises then it\'s a well told story. The book itself is entering the theaters in November and I saw a trailer for it on Sunday night. The trailer was so good I figured this was "next" for me in the tournament. So a second "space" book.The Martian is about a botanist who is part of a team of 6 on the third manned mission to Mars. After six days on Mars a storm hits the team, they have to abort the mission, and leave Mars. Unfortunately, the main character, Mark Watney, is left stranded on Mars. The book is mostly a first-person point of view story about what Mark does being stranded on Mars. I don\'t want to give this story away because it is too good but I laughed, I cheered, I cried, I felt with Mark Watney everything he went through.If the tournament was done and over tonight I\'d have an immediate and easy decision to make for the winner. The Martian was that good and that fun. One question the book danced around and at least philosophically caused me to ask is what is the value of saving a human life? Certainly a good question to ponder. Goodreads readers have given The Martian an average score of 4.35. I gave it five stars.'
p3007
aS'This is a "how to" manual.  Really kind of boring.  The author uses stereotypes to formulate what his characters say.  Even his hero is a cardboard cut out.  Each plays their narrow role and then disappears from the scene.  Some come back to again play their narrow, stereotyped role for a little bit and then back into the crypt.He\'s got an engineer lamenting all that wasted education just to watch a monitor of photos of Mars, suddenly changing into a tearful, fearful employee meeting the director of the project.  He\'s got a mission commander crying !!  And second guessing her decision made in a desperate situation.  He\'s got the press person foul mouthing everyone behind the scenes when these are the people she works for.  You do not get the best from people when you berate them and the press and do not work with them to really understand the situation.Wait!!  These people are all women!!!  No wonder they fall apart!!  No wonder they can\'t do their jobs as a professional!!  Got to have that stereotype loud and clear!!  Where is this author\'s head?  Writing how-to books -- ok.  Writing fiction -- not so good.'

p3010
aS'Wow!  The first few pages I was actually hooked and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to read the entire book.  However it quickly changed to nothing more than chemistry/botany lessons for the next several chapters and beyond, which soon became mind numbing.  I really must start paying attention to the one and two star ratings because they were so accurate on this book and many had stopped reading within the first few chapters (lucky them).  I carried on thinking there must be more to this book having received so much hype.  I was going to give it 2 stars for effort and the actual story line was a good idea, but after laboring almost to the end it really is only a 1 star at best.  If still considering buying be sure and read all the 1 and 2 stars ratings.'

aS'I read this book and thought they have to make a movie of this book... Not knowing that it already was in the making...wow... What an amazing book.  Character development is incredible and the science of it all!!!  So great... This book is a must own hardback for the library...'

aS"Unusual story.  The technology was very impressive.  I can't wait to see the movie.."
p3014
aS"I love sci-fi movies, but I hate sci-fi books.  Generally speaking.  They always feel like foreign language to me, because so many sci-fi authors create their own languages to go with their own worlds.  Can't read the typical sci-fi series for that reason.  I need more books like The Martian.  The main character here does speak another language that I don't understand, which is the language of engineering, but you don't need to fully understand everything he's doing to enjoy the book.  It's almost impossible to put down.  Now I'm just sad this author doesn't have a few dozen other books I can read.  I guess the point of this review is that this is a great sci-fi book for people who don't usually do well with sci-fi.  If you loved Swiss Family Robinson and Robinson Caruso, this will be right up your alley."
p3015
aS'It was too short'
p3016
aS'Realized this was going to be a movie soon but didn\'t let that stop me from enjoying every word. Got caught reading this at work and got a big frown but I didn\'t care. Technically, literally, figuratively, and any other "ly" I can speak to, this was a great read. More please more.'
p3017
aS'What I liked about this book is that it didn\'t deal with the typical relationship issues and stuck with the story line of a man stranded on an uninhabitable planet, Mars, and how he comes up with a plan to survive and hopefully get rescued. Also appreciated the fact the the female characters were smart and respected. The male characters who were under the authority of the female commander weren\'t always challenging her authority. The women came across as smart, capable members of the team (could have been more of them). I was also pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed much of the descriptions of the scientific solutions the main character, Mark Watney has to come up with to survive and get off Mars, although sometimes explained in boring detail. I did skim a bit, and frankly didn\'t understand some of it. I felt that Watney\'s attitude wasn\'t credible in that he came across to me just a bit too focused/calm for someone facing over a year on a desolate planet or possibly not surviving at all. With major obstacles and life threatening situations he just responds as if to say, "bummer, this is going to make me change my plans, but oh well I\'ll just have to come up with another brilliant idea." But then again, the idea is that we are reading his logs so aren\'t privy to the times where he would possibly give into major emotional/mental meltdowns.*POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT* Like other reviewers I felt the ending was a disappointment; would have liked the author to write more on what happened in the lives of the main characters after they returned to earth and the mission was over. It was like "objective met, end of story." Too abrupt.I think the casting of Matt Damon for the movie version will be good as it seems the character was written for him. All said there was never a time while reading it that I was tempted to not finish, and will most likely watch the film version. If you have even a mild interest in sci fi you should enjoy it.'
p3018
aS'Had a lot of potential, but got lost in textbook like details. Got tedious. No way could I finish reading this book. Was a real letdown.'
p3019
aS"Way too Scientific/Chemistry/Electrical, for a normal person to comprehend...draws out as boring discussing stuff you can't even understand.  I would not recommend this book, and now that I have read it, I doubt that I will go to the movie to see it."
p3020
aS'This is one of the most exciting and well written stories I\'ve read in a long time.  I\'m not really a fan of science or science fiction but my son recommended it and I\'m glad he did!Every situation was meticulously researched and presented in a way that made you feel like this was something that could REALLY happen.  I laughed out loud (in quite a few public places) at the sarcasm and wit of "Mark Watney" and although the mathematical calculations and specific Space Industry terms were far too advanced for my understanding they didn\'t deter me from holding my breath as the drama unfolded.Highly recommended!  You won\'t put it down!'
p3021
aS"I had high expectations when I started this read, hoping it would be somehow similar to Philip Wylie's When/After Worlds Collide from many years ago. I admit to skimming more and more pages where hero astronaut Mark Watney described endless Mackyver solutions to his precarious situation. If those solutions were to be removed from the story, the book would be quite a thin one indeed and I certainly don't have the knowledge to even know if the solutions were sound, or fiction as well. The ending also seemed rushed and I had trouble envisioning how it actually occurred."
p3022
aS'Liked the book but about 62% through it got a bit repetitive. Thought the humor was a bit trite.'
p3023
aS'Not many books grab me immediately from reading the sample and force me to keep reading until I am finished.  So, I recommend this book to anybody who likes "hard" science fiction.  The details of how the protagonist keeps surviving being abandoned on Mars are compelling, and the suspense is gripping.  The log-entry style of writing works pretty well, especially because the protagonist is the only human on Mars, so there is no need for dialogue.  Despite the detailed science and engineering descriptions, this book has a sense of humor that had me laughing out loud several times.I don\'t award it five stars, because I feel the protagonist lacks certain types of emotional depth (in fact, he is relentlessly cheerful), and because the straight male view of the female characters offended me.  Also, taken as a whole, this is a highly improbable story, I would\'ve found it more credible had it ended differently [I won\'t say more].'
p3024
aS'After seeing a preview to the film several weeks back, I instantly figured this would be a movie I was going to see for sure. The entire premise just struck me as utterly compelling. I was unaware of the novel at that time. Saw it at the book store a few days later and picked it up. I read quite a bit that first night. I must say I haven\'t read a novel this compelling in quite a few years.First off, kudos to Andy Weir for doing his homework. I\'m sure preparations to write this was exhaustive and you can tell. The science--at least to me anyway--seems about as real as it gets. There may be a few things discussed that haven\'t come about just yet--but I would venture to say they are all based in GENUINE science, which is one of the core reasons the novel was so fantastic. Being stranded on Mars, literally and entirely alone, with essentially zero hope of survival, no way to communicate with earth to speak of and supplies that simply cannot last until the next Mars mission (some 4 years away) arrives, how in the WORLD do you overcome this kind of herculean obstacle? In the same way that NASA came together to bring the men of Apollo 13 home safely (seriously, bringing them home after what had happened to their ship was easily a bigger miracle than landing Neil and Buzz on the moon and bringing them back), the world comes together to bring astronaut Mark Watney home from Mars.About 100 pages into the book, I got to wondering how the author was going to handle the day-to-day business of surviving, based on the situation and how many close brushes with death he endures and make it all not just readable, but thoroughly entertaining? I can tell you this: Andy Weir pulls it off in style. Part of that was his careful plotting. Face it, unless you are familiar with the in\'s and out\'s of literally going to another planet and what it would take in order to REALLY pull that off, you might be a bit confused at how someone can make all of those sordid details interesting, but boy is it. Everything from making water out of incredibly dangerous hydrazine rocket propellant, how to grow potatoes on Mars when technically it should be entirely impossible to do so and how to traverse great distances on the surface in order to ensure your survival, its all here. As the novel progresses towards the climax, I can say that Mr. Weir notched up the thrills by making it all sound amazingly realistic. Does everything go as planned? Heck no. In fact, Mark Watney nearly kills himself many, many times--some due to his own mistakes, some beyond his control, and it all makes for an incredibly GENUINE experience. Plenty of times I felt like I was reading what actually HAD happened versus a true-to-life sci-fi novel. Yes, the science IS real--even if you don\'t understand it, the author does a great job of "dumbing it down" in order to better process what is happening and why. At its core, The Martian is a story of incredible tenacity, determination and an amazing will to live by someone who--by all rights--should have died on the lonely surface of another planet. His triumphs as well as his failures all ring true and that is part of what makes this book simply incredible.In short: I LOVED THIS BOOK. I was interested in seeing the movie before, but now I\'m downright excited. My only worry now is whether or not they screw it up--as Hollywood does 99 out of a 100 times they adapt an excellent novel into a film. Just FOLLOW the damn story folks, the closer the better. Its what makes the book amazing in the first place. Don\'t mess with it unless absolutely necessary. In this particular case, the closer they adhere to the story, the more compelling it will be on the big screen, especially the very last 15-20 minutes. Please, PLEASE don\'t screw it up!'
p3025

p3026
aS"If you've seen the film, read it! If you haven't seen the film read it! You will not regret it, this book is fantastic!"
p3027
aS'Great sense of humor.  Lots of technical jargon but suspenseful and I laughed out loud at certain points. A worthwhile read.'
p3028
aS'I don\'t usually review books although I read an incredible amount of them. Generally I know how a book will unfold and that was no exception with this one. After all I\'m a psychic and a medium but this book made me enjoy almost every minute of it. Mark Watney was likable and had you cheering him with each new turn. Though I had to work, the book would call to me with it\'s page turning effect. The Martian was bought by me because I wanted to see the movie but wanted to read Andy Weir\'s rendition first. If the movie lives up to the book, I can\'t wait. Few books get my attention and keep it the way this one did. Though I love math and science I\'m a psychological thriller kind of girl who\'s worked with various law enforcement agencies and who\'s glad she read "The Martian."'
p3029
aS'Ok read. Hard to carry story with only one character and predictable ending.'
p3030
aS"I admit it. I got 75% through the book and gave up. At first I forgave all the mathematics. The endless numbers and formulas the author put me though. I keep reading thinking it was all going to slow down at some point. But the geeky formulas and numbers never did. This read more like a technical manual of how to survive on Mars with limited equipment, than it did a story with interesting characters. It was far more work to read it than the story paid back in enjoyment. A huge disappointment. If you're not a geek, like me, you probably won't enjoy this book."
p3031
aS"One of the best books I've read in a long time. Among my favorites ever read. Avoid watching the trailer for the film if you plan on reading this as it completely spoils the story. This is a book where you want to know nothing going into it."
p3032
aS'Clever, gripping, and a wonderful overall read. Puts the science back in science fiction.'
p3033
aS'Amazing. Intense and sleekly written, with punctuations of brilliant hilarity. And the math is real!'
p3034
aS"This is a fantastic story but I lost track of how many f-bombs the characters used. If an edited version existed it'd be 5 stars without a doubt."
p3035
aS"The book was amazing so why a three? Skimmed several large chunks in the second half. All the technical details just couldn't hold my attention. The action slowed and it was like detailed and technical description of someone washing a car for all I understood it. The first half held my attention as did the last nail biting  part. Then it abruptly ended.  It was a shock and I would have really liked to hear about the return trip minus all thtech details . a lot of nail can't get this thing to work so I hope you get the idea ."
p3036
aS'I had no idea there were so many astro physicists making reviews on Amazon - who else would give this book 5 stars?The "stranded on Mars" premise is fascinating and is what made me buy this book. How the heck will he get out of this jam, i wondered. I also secretly hoped there would be aliens (there were none). Instead we get to learn in long tedious detail - and i mean DETAIL - how the Martian manages to improvise himself out of every dangerous situation using mathematics, chemistry and physics. Doesn\'t matter if its a sand storm, lack of food or whatever - he will put some stuff together like a space McGyver and make everything ok again while cheerfully joking about it in his space log.Now, if you are indeed an astronaut or space engineer reading this book, i would assume you would nod your head, rub your beard and think "yeah, thats pretty much how it would be done" but for the rest of us, its just a bunch of technical stuff we cant relate to. How much is even real tech or made up future tech? If most of it is made up future tech - the entire book becomes irrelevant. There are MUCH better sci-fi reads out there if youre looking for cool fantasy technology.The only thing that grabbed me was him beeing alone at Mars and Nasa finding out he was there alive. The rest just becomes a long winded problem solving tech porn drama with predictable events and even anti-climaxes.Over-rated, but for a geek like me it was still a nice read but no more than 3 stars = "good", not great and certainly not "epic".'

aS'Mylar.On page 227 I read "I should mention that Mylar is conductive."In fact, Mylar is a superb insulator and dielectric and very popular for those uses since the \'60s. The DuPont fact sheets are easy to find. The author may have meant Mylar with an aluminum film on the surface, but who knows? There are many other such mistakes (for example, claiming that 36VDC is a lethal hazard when your home telephone wires have 48VDC on them).'

aS'Very well written.'
p3041

aS'It was an easy read with some very interesting twists.'
p3043
aS'I was really looking forward to reading The Martian. Unfortunately, it reads like a high school diary. I find Mark Watney to be an annoying character. He spends the entire book cursing some unforeseen, life-threatening problem, and follows it up with some quick ingenious solution. ("Oh, crap! I am going to die! Wait! I have an impossible way to fix that!"). After six chapters, you are finally introduced to other characters. However, they are flat, and are just as unlikable.Maybe halfway through, There is interaction between Watney and NASA, but it disappointed me greatly. After being alone for months, all the protagonist has are cursing, sarcasm, and an inflated ego. Not how I picture anyone speaking to people who want to save them.The book\'s saving grace is its attention to detail. The solutions to the danger are miraculous, yet plausible. The descriptions of the various equipment was intriguing and revealed a great knowledge of the field. It wasn\'t the technology, the descriptions, or the setting that brought down the story; it was the people.'
p3044
aS'A fun "popcorn" novel, "The Martian" entertained me the entire time I was reading it. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys survival or science fiction narratives. Although some foul language exists in the novel, the subject matter is appropriate for anyone in high school or above. Do not expect, however, fantastic prose but a solid story of survival.'

aS"Fascinatingly fun read. Read it in 2 days. Couldn't put it down!"
p3046
aS'The book was really good. It had suspense but it also had some science background that went into a great deal of detail. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the end (as in literally the last page). The ending itself was perfectly fine but the last page lacked a sense of closure. Other than that, it was a really good book.'

Here\'s an example of how bad this book is: "Over the past few days, I\'ve been happily making water. It\'s been going swimmingly. (See what i did there? "Swimmingly?")" You would be better off with Robinson Crusoe. I can\'t believe this has been taken up by Random House.'
p3051
aS"I ordered this book after hearing a NPR interview of the Andy Weir.  Traveling in space is a subject I love to read and his style appealed to me.  I'm not an engineer but was able to follow almost all of his details of survival on Mars.  Totally exciting from the first chapter.If he writes another scifi book I'll read it."

p3053
aS"This otherwise excellent story leaves a bad taste in your mouth  right up to the very end.  It insults the reader.Here is a story about a man who is supposed to have superior intelligence and character, having been chosen as a elite member of  the space program to Mars.He survives insurmountable odds outwitting the space program's very best.  One would expect to want cheer his survival but in the end he behaves no better than  a base oaf.  Too selfish to be kind even to a young chid admirer.No space program would select such a loser."

aS'This review is for the Audio CD...the story is excellent..but that information is not news to anyone reading the reviews here. What I wanted to add is the audio cd is not only a great story but the narrator is perfect....he plays Mark Watley exactly as I would imagine that astronauts voice to be. His narration skills make this CD a wonderful piece of entertainment!'

aS"I was a cliche of wasted youth melting away the 80's and 90's in a hallucinogenic haze. Most of my traveling was done on the coattails of Jerry Garcia et al, if that tells you anything. So I refuse in my later years to waste any more time on Russian lit or crap like the Martian. I have almost never been less interested in a character in my entire life. I've completed 43% of the novel and am begging for this guy to die so it will end my suffering. I think one star is generous here. If I didn't love my friend who recommended this piece I'd unfriend her. This is almost a deal breaker for me. I have not been this disgusted or bored since I read the Book of Mormon as an adult. I would rather time travel to the 70's and sing Popcorn Popping on the Apricot Tree on fast Sunday during testimony day at the LDS church than read one more page of this filth."

aS'If you love science, a good survival story and a lovable, wise-cracking protagonist you will absolutely love this story.  I highly recommend this book!'

aS'[INCLUDES SPOILERS]I don\'t think I\'ve ever written an Amazon review in my life, but after finishing this book I feel like I have to take out my frustrations somewhere.At the beginning it was very enjoyable, and I really wanted to keep enjoying it. I thought Watney\'s sense of humor was refreshing and I actually found myself laughing out loud more than once.But as time went on, it was just more of the same over and over and over and over again. Somewhat predictable technical problem, pause, dry explanation of how he fixes it. Rinse, repeat. As many others have pointed out, there was zero character development. Watney\'s attitude and writing style seemed to be the same on day 1 as on day 450, after over a year of being almost completely isolated. We learn nothing about him as a person, or about anyone else for that matter. All the characters seemed very 1 dimensional.The scientific solutions to his problems were interesting at first, but grew tiring later on as it just seemed like more of the same. I found my eyes glazing over and skimming parts, and I\'m someone who really enjoys the science part of science fiction.As I got further along in the book I realized I could hardly distinguish between the other characters. My first reaction was to go back and try to figure out who was who in the fictional version of NASA, but then I realized it didn\'t matter. Anyone could\'ve been saying any of the lines. The easiest way to tell the characters apart was to look at the amount of needless profanity they used (and I mean truly needless -- I\'m happy to have swearing where it makes sense and have no moral objection or anything).Another reviewer pointed out that it sounded like Watney\'s journal entries were written by a teenager on reddit, and I think that\'s absolutely spot on. A couple of lines that really stuck out to me were when he jokingly referred to a probe as "gay" or towards the end of the book, as he\'s making the modifications to the ARES-4 MAV, he writes: "The lunatics at NASA have me doing all kinds of rape to the MAV." Seriously? Rape?I stopped enjoying this book somewhere around a third of the way through, but I kept reading because I was invested and wanted to know what happened. If you find yourself at that point, do yourself a favor and just stop--it\'s not worth going on. It just gets worse and there\'s nothing satisfying about getting to the end.'
p3060
aS'Yes, this is an OK book for techno-geeks.  It\'s inventive, moderately credible,and holds the interest.  I don\'t down-grade it because I\'m not a geek, but rather because its inventiveness is often contrived, a lazy author trying to fix a faulty narrative.  And yes, because of the profanity (including the useless, boring F-bomb), which is about as attractive as any other pre-adolescent "cussing."'
p3061
aS"A very interesting story about an astronaut left behind and assumed dead.Too many technical statistics and too long. We didn't need to know how many potatoes and how much hydrogen is produced to help him.Half way through I was ready to to the last chapter. Not enough character development."
p3062
aS'Don\'t waste your money. This book is boring. It has no realistic character development. Therefor the empathy and situational intensity of the  "Martian" is lost completely to a bunch of technical jargon that appears to try to impress you. A good novel with a novel, well written story impresses me. This jargon is also extremely tedious to read through. Everyone is looking for a great sci-fi  - this is not the one.'
p3063
aS'It was continuous adventure that kept me on the edge of my seat. It had just enough techie stuff to make me believe everything was true. On par with "gravity".'
p3064
aS"This story is a great time. Real science paired with the snark and bouyance of Watney's personality make his plight harrowing but bearable. Solid writing and a strong voice help create a new classic."
p3065
aS'Wish there was more! Great reading!!'
p3066
aS'Being stranded on Mars is a problem. It isn\'t like being stranded in the jungle where the abundance of flora and fauna are out to kill you. The problem with Mars is that there is nothing there to take notice of you at all. No plants. No animals. No water. These are just some of the issues that Mark Watney must overcome when he becomes separated from his crew during a sand storm. Everyone thinks that he has died, until they discover that he hasn\'t.Andy Weir does an amazing job of talking through the technical aspects of trying to survive on a lifeless planet. His description of the situation, the equipment, and the "pirate ninjas" of the situation will draw you in and have you rooting for Watney the whole time. This book is one that young people need to read to reignite their interest in Science and Math because... well, the whole thing is amazingly cool and exciting.Weir is a self described nerd, and thank God. He seems to have a grasp on the technical side of every problem. It is easy to get drawn into the desire to survive in a world where hunting and gathering (our normal "stranded" procedure as humans) won\'t work. I sincerely and truly loved this book.'
p3067
aS'Suspenseful yet many funny moments.  Kept my interest.'
p3068
aS'This book is about the survival of an astronaut stranded on Mars.  The struggle to survive is centered on engineering solutions rather than bravery.  The technical aspects seem plausible and the hero struggles to survive by the use of knowledge and ingenuity.  This book was a pleasure to read.'
p3069
aS'Enjoyed it a lot.'
p3070
aS'A great read, if at times overly technical and complex, but the way it was written you could spend as much time as you wanted getting deep into the math calculations, or just gloss over the "geek" and move along with the story.'
p3071
aS"This may now be my favorite book ever. Scientifically accurate Martian Robinson Crusoe? Everyone's got to pick this up."
p3072
aS'Needed one more visit with the editor.'
p3073
aS'I came across this book via Air and Space magazine. It was one of the few books I\'ve read that had that "can\'t put it down" affect. It was a bit heavy on the science in some places for my taste but it still deserved five stars.'
p3074
aS'Simple plot, very well executed. Captured both the by-the-book professionalism of the NASA mission team and the by-the-seat-of-the-pants improvisation (and spirit) needed to survive.  Well written, with enough technospeak to keep geeks happy, but with enough explanation for mortals like me to understand.  Great fun!'
p3075
aS'I know there are tons of reviews for this novel, but I will add my tiny drop to the bucket.  This great story would get 5 stars from me if it wasn\'t for the pervasive use of the "F" word.  Disappointed that the author couldn\'t have present this excellent story without the profanity.  Hope the movie leaves it out.'
p3076
aS"I did not expect to enjoy this book as much as I did.  Bought it for a family member who liked it so much she read it twice.  I brought it on vacation and couldn't put it down.  My 84 years young cousin read it next and she loved it too."
p3077
aS"I'm honestly amazed at just how glued to this book I got; I bought it after seeing the movie, so I already knew a ton of what happened, and yet I was still constantly coming back for more.  Well worth the read!"
p3078
aS'Overall a pretty good book. If you like thinking about how to survive the zombie apocalypse, then this is enjoyable because thinking about how to survive the wastelands of Mars is a similar concept.'
p3079
aS"I thought this was a great book. It's very scientifically oriented in the sense that the author tries to be as scientifically accurate as possible. The problems and solutions fit in with the scenario the author creates on Mars. It's a thrilling and worthwhile read."
p3080
aS'Amazing book'
p3081
aS'What a great story!!'
p3082
aS"I don't usually read science fiction :) but I really enjoyed this book. At first I tried to follow most of the science and visualize everything using my imagination but I finally let go of that and just enjoyed the story.  Yes I enjoyed the story. There's no way you can't cheer for Mark Watney. His sense of humor and personality made the book for me."
p3083
aS'Great Science Fiction. Abandoned on Mars, left just with his knowledge. I loved all the scientific details.'
p3084
aS'I am not particularly savvy with science or math.  I wondered if the book would be to over my head.  The author did a remarkable job of giving a basic understanding of the sciences while keeping me enthralled with the suspense of the plot. It was a fast read and a true page turner. When it came to its conclusion I wanted to read on! The only negative...it came to The End.'
p3085
aS'The Martian is a story about a guy, Mark Watney, that has been left alive and alone on Mars, all the other astronauts has left the planet, they think he is dead and he will have to try to survive until they rescue him\xe2\x80\xa6if they rescue him since they don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he is alive.I\xe2\x80\x99m may be a nerd in many ways, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure as hell aren\xe2\x80\x99t a science nerd. I decided to read The Martian after reading glowing reviews of the book on Goodreads, it sounded so fun and adventurous and it was\xe2\x80\xa6it was also a hell of a lot of science involved in the book. I mean in the beginning I tried to keep up but after a while I just gave up and thought \xe2\x80\x9cno I\xe2\x80\x99m not in school anymore, I will not try to force myself to understand things that I will not be tested for later.\xe2\x80\x9dBut there are at least some bright spots in the book and it\xe2\x80\x99s the humor for instance: \xe2\x80\x9cI was just one of her crew. Actually, I was the lowest ranked member of the crew. I would only be \xe2\x80\x9cin command\xe2\x80\x9d of the mission if I were the only remaining person. What do you know? I\xe2\x80\x99m in command.\xe2\x80\x9dAt least the ending was good and intense. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a space novel and are not afraid of science, chemistry or math (shuddering) then you will love this book.'
p3086
aS'Great book! Highly recommend to anyone with an interest in science in general.'
p3087
aS'I kept expecting some cheap sci-fi stuff to appear . It never did . When he plants his potatoes I fully expected some ancient Martian seed to Sally forth with a purple three headed pumpkin or some such .  Or , a version of a " little house of horrors" . Gratefully it didn\'t . I felt as though I was Mark and the stuff was real .  This book is one of those rare joys of literature. A captivating ride on Mars brought to life . My life!'
p3088
aS'Fantastic!!! Loved it!!'
p3089
aS'It is clear that the author really knows his science and physics and this book is filled with it, which is an essential part of the narrative.  The central character Mark Watney is witty and amusing and I was laughing out loud frequently while reading this book.  I particularly enjoyed candid contemporary language that gave the entire narrative a gritty credible reality.  It is unusual to find a book where all of the characters swear and curse just like normal people do and it adds a delightful layer of verisimilitude. I only have one very minor pet peeve where the author got some of his science wrong.  There is a situation where the Chinese supply ship is docking with the American interplanetary craft, and the supply ship is approaching at 2 meters per second from 60 meter range.  In final approach it is still going at .9 m/s.  This would be an absolute disaster for two multiple ton spacecraft!  I think he got his speeds off by three decimal places!  Somehow this glaring error really sticks out in my memory despite all the other excellent science and humor.'
p3090
aS'I enjoyed half the technical explanations, after that they ceased being entertaining. Writing level is about 11 th grade. I only had to look up one word - "akimbo". I am looking forward to the movie as this script is pretty good.'
p3091
aS'Got through maybe 15 pages and closed it because this was all scientific calculations and endless, endless, ENDLESS amounts of technical crap. No story there. Just him trying to figure out how to make water from chemicals and all kinds of nonsense. I felt like I was in chemistry class. Terrible.'
p3092
aS"I watched an interview of the author after I read the book and it turns out pretty much everything science related in this book he personally researched and worked out the math for. It's astounding how well everything works together. In the beginning you kind of get a Castaway feel, where you don't know how the main character Mark Watney is going to get off Mars, of if he'll survive at all. It's a humorous but gripping tale, and I'd highly recommend this book to anyone."
p3093
aS"It's really just a short novella bulked up with boring and repetitive calculating and description of how things work which is distracting from narrative and character development."

aS'Day 1.I\'m screwed.  Baseball season is starting.  I have a great book about baseball that I really want to read, but I\'m stuck reading "The Martian" by Andy Weir.  I sit and read during my lunchbreaks every day at work, and a lot of my coworkers see me.  Well, a coworker brought me this book and insisted I read it.  I have a stack of books I want to read, but here I am reading this one.  I don\'t even know the guy\'s name!  And I\'m going to write a review of the book.  I don\'t know why.  Nobody will read it.  Well, the internet is forever, right?  So maybe some day someone will read it.  So, yeah.  I\'m screwed.Day 15.I\'m really enjoying this book.  A couple of coworkers interrupted me today and I was telling them about it.  About an astronaut who finds himself stranded alone on Mars.  I find the story actually believable, and the ideas he comes up with to survive are very creative.  The guy who gave me the book caught me telling the other two how great the book is.  His name is Ken.  My friend\'s name is Ken.Day 23.I went out of town for a few days and took the book with me.  And, of course, when I returned, I had left the book behind.  Well, it was at my parents\' house, so Mom overnighted it back to me.  Only cost me two days reading time.  Of course, I could have ordered a new one in the same time.  I didn\'t need to, but I could have.  I\'m just saying.  Somewhere in transit, the cover was torn.  A little duct tape fixed it right up.  Duct tape is magic, you know.Day 30.Just a few pages left.  Lots of interruptions today, but I got it done.  Great book.  A book about a smart assed astronaut in an impossible situation and how he tries to survive.  it\'s brilliant.  Can\'t wait for the movie.  Matt Damon has the lead.  Look!  A pair of boobs!  (.Y.)'
p3095
aS'Too much detail!!'
p3096
aS"I skipped ahead, just couldn't get into it"
p3097
aS'If you are interested in Sci-Fi that reads like it was written by a teenage boy, this is the book for you. The writing is so pedestrian  and the author feels the need to explain every little thing (example: "CO2 is carbon dioxide") that I couldn\'t get through the whole book. This is an author that thinks his audience isn\'t as smart as he is and, to give Weir credit, I feel pretty dumb for having spent my money on his book.'
p3098
aS"I couldn't put the book down but I haven't been subjected to such terrible profanity since I was in the army."
p3099
aS'Great book. As a 90\'s "kid" it feels a bit like Mcguyver in space but in a good and exciting sense!! Only watched the trailer of the movie after I read the book. It was a good call burlt trailer is almost what I imagined. I would recommend it to all audiences!!'
p3100
aS'Fantastic'
p3101
aS'This was the first book in months that made me stay up until 4 am to finish it. The story is great and the dialogue is very humorous.First, some criticisms: it definitely could have used some editing in how parts of the story were organized--there\'s more than one Chekhov\'s Gun or plot device that comes out of nowhere which probably could have been avoided. However, that doesn\'t detract from a gripping story. At times, the dialogue comes across as not being realistic for astronauts chosen to be part of a Mars mission--but then, without some color, the story would have been much more bland. Most of the story is from a narrative, but in instances where there is some substantial conversation, Weir sometimes is too wordy and trips over himself. Of course, at this point, I\'m kind of picking at things to critique--this was a GREAT story.This definitely has some hard sci-fi elements, but it\'s written in an accessible manner that many can appreciate. Think of this as somewhere between MacGyver and Apollo 13, with better story and dialogue than the former, and more science and math background than the latter. Add a dash of Mars and put the story in the near-future, and you have "The Martian" by Andy Weir.Be forewarned--there\'s a substantial amount of language in this book, if such things offend you. However, I\'m recommending this book to everyone I know. You won\'t be disappointed.'
p3102
aS"Gripping story about man versus nature. Mark Watney, the story's protagonist, is the man. A Martian MacGuyver. Enjoyed every second of it until it's gripping conclusion. A must read."
p3103
aS"Yup - everyone has been right about this book!  A real page-turner which follows the astronaut while he works to resolve endless problems that crop up to threaten his life and chances of being rescued. The book can be quite technical in parts, but he explains everything in a very accessible way.  Don't miss this futuristic version of Gulliver's Travels!"
p3104
aS"I only paid $.99 for this kindle book and was ready to delete it if it didn't get my interest right away...surprisingly, I was glued to the book all day till I got it finished.  Some of the technical stuff got a little over my head and I wondered if he needed to get that detailed, but actually he did to keep this story believable.  Mark, the marooned astronaut, has a great sense of humor as well as being creative and very intellegent.  As you may expect there is quite alot of suspense to all this.  He has a lot to figure out and only so much food and breathable air...the first problem was his crew left him for dead...and he was not dead and they didn't know that.  It takes months and months to travel from earth to mars and when they don't even know you are alive and waiting for a rescue.....well, you can see the plot thicken right away.  It's a pretty fast read and I think it was well worth my time for the trip into space!"
p3105
aS"This book made me smile and cheer.  I normally don't outright cheer for the protagonist, but in this book I cheered when he figured something out and of course wanted him to be rescued.  I also loved the hard science.  the author is obviosly a geek, and that is a good thing.  Read this book!"
p3106
aS'This was a fun read. It was not what I expected and glad it was different. Well worth the dime I dropped on it.'
p3107
aS'Started out fine but after awhile the continuous "I fixed this, dug this hole, etc" narrative became tedious, like I was reading an engineering report. Where was the emotion? I just finished the book and I don\'t remember if he even had a family, because he hardly talked about it. Friends? I don\'t know. All he seemed to do was talk about all the hab fixes and sciency stuff.The movie will probably be ok, all action-packed and stuff. But I\'m one of the minority of readers who likes to have a bit more depth than "just things happening that are incredible". I like to have a balance of the action along with some storyline, which is really absent with this book.Meh.'
p3108
aS'This is a great book.  I so loved the main character Watney.  He was funny, and very resourceful.  There was a little too much technical scientific stuff at time for me, but still an awesome read.'
p3109
aS'wow. After reading countless positive reviews e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e on the net I picked up a copy and was immediately disappointed. As a grown man I felt as if I were reading a story written for \'boys life\' magazine. The narrative was completely incongruous and insulting to the perspective of someone trapped on Mars documenting their tale. You also find yourself thinking aloud "Thank you Captain Obvious" every other page. It\'s honestly as if Weir read too many B sci-fi novels growing up and decided to try his hand at writing - it\'s painful. Instead of convincing the reader, instead of entertaining the reader, instead of interesting the reader in scientific insight we are fed a constant stream of "this does that, so I did this with that, then this happened and I made this with that". No wonder it appealed to the geek crowd of \'shut-ins\' neurotically tinkering away stranded in their own world of isolation. No wonder Hollywood is making this lowest-common-denominator book into a lowest-common-denominator movie. I\'m ashamed for publishing that no one has come forward to criticize this book more widely.'
p3110
aS'Fun read.'
p3111
aS'For the cost of the book, it might be worth buying. It was not, however worth the time spent reading. Some of the science and problem solving were described well. There was very little description of the setting. It was more about survival in an extreme environment and could have been set anywhere. The main character was unbelievable because of his juvenile nature. Astronauts are highly intelligent and screened for their psychological ability to handle long duration missions. It is obvious the main character would not be suitable for such mission. Some of the science is wrong and not well researched. Some of it is correct and well described.Another frustrating facet is that Amazon did not make it clear that this is not a "professionally" published book. It was clear after I purchased it because of the typos, weak story, and poor writing.In sum, if you like problem solving and survival stories then you may like this book. I did not enjoy it.'
p3112
aS"Great read..can't wait for the movie"
p3113
aS"Astronaut Mark Watney has been accidentally left on Mars and must figure out a way to survive. This is an awesome premise for a book, and this novel does not disappoint. Admittedly, there are several MacGyver moments when Watney's jury-rigged solutions seem contrived, but this didn't really interfere with my enjoyment of the book; it was all part of the fun. Unlike MacGyver, Watney isn't always successful with his tinkering. The science seemed accurate (even though I'm not a scientist and probably wouldn't know the difference). In fact, it got a little too technical for my tastes at times. However, this only added to the verisimilitude and drew me back into the story. What impressed me the most was Weir's excellent command of the pacing of the plot. The balance between suspense, self-reflection, and humor was almost perfect. Write also did a nice job with the scope of the book, drawing in NASA people and even the crew of Watney's mission to broaden the importance of what the lost astronaut was going through. I really had a great time reading this book.\xc2\xa0"
p3114
aS"Full of wanky technical jargon that added little to the story. I don't really care how many kilojoules there are in a potato and nor do I give a hoot about the hydrogen content of urine."
p3115
aS'I really enjoyed this book it kept me really captivated and I was just amazed at all the great utilization of scientific facts to make scifi so realistic. Would definitely recommend.'
p3116
aS'Very enjoyable piece of science fiction which, based in the near future, strives as best it can to read like science fact. No aliens, inter-galactic battles, time travel or warp drive.... Just a 21st century human being using science, engineering and creative skills in an attempt to surmount overwhelming difficulties.'
p3117
aS"Surprisingly funny!  I finished the book in a couple days, I just couldn't put it down."
p3118
aS'This is a great story that kept me up all night reading it. It is basically the story of an astronaut who is accidentally stranded on Mars because the rest of the crew thinks he is dead and they were not able to recover his body before they had to evacuate. Rather than curling up into a fetal position and dying, he keeps using his head and "working the problem" in order to survive until he can be rescued. This story is set roughly twenty years from now. If you have any kind of science, engineering or military background, you will very likely love this story and the overall attitude behind it. If you don\'t know much about Mars, you will probably learn quite a bit about it from this book.The main big error has to do with how forceful that high velocity winds would be in the low pressure atmosphere on Mars. I also think that the communications difficulties are a little exaggerated. Right now, we currently have several orbiters over Mars that are able to communicate via line of sight with our two active rovers on Mars. In the story, the stranded astronaut has two crew rovers that have low power radios that would probably be able to communicate with some of the Mars orbiters that they would have at the time.Finally, several reviewers have complained about the frequent usage of the evil F-word by the characters in the book. Really, they need to get over it. That is simply how most people talk when they are under extreme stress, especially in the military. I am sure it is the same way at NASA/JPL in stressful situations. You don\'t hear too many people saying "Gosh darn it" when lives are at stake. But if you will be deeply offended by some realistic profanity, then perhaps you should not read this book.'
p3119
aS"Rare good read for fans of hard science fiction.  It's finally far-fetched and completely improbable in my view, but the author makes surviving various disasters on Mars plausible enough to carry a good story."
p3120
aS'I am firmly in the camp of those reviewers who\'ve said "This is the best hard sci-fi I\'ve read in a looong while". Got it as a bedtime read - finally had to surrender to sleep at something after 2am. And was right back on it first thing the next morning (thank goodness for the holidays).Mixes the best of the HW Bush era SEI program with Zubrin\'s Mars Direct. Takes the dry details  brings them pulse-poundingly(is that a word? even hyphenated?) to life.One of the best 99 cent books out there. I\'ll definitely be looking for more from Andy Weir!'

p3123
aS'Brilliant, funny, suspenseful, but not impossible, if you keep your wits. in other words, "The Right Stuff".'
p3124
aS'The plot line is exciting and the main character is a genius but the writing depicts a character who is so unbelievable and unlikeable I could only force myself to read through about a third of it before I removed it from my reading list.  The main character is supposed to be an amazing scientist and professional who is on a Mars mission but he writes his log as if he were a ninth grader.  He swears gratuitously, far beyond the point where it gets annoying, making it difficult to read.  I hope the movie studios are able to take the skeleton story and the science and turn this into a great movie with a likeable protagonist.'
p3125
aS'The Martian is an intense thrill ride that causes you to develop an attachment to the main character, Mark Watney, you are rooting for him the whole time and become emotionally invested in his survival. It is a gripping survival story that showcases the humor, ingenuity and resilience of one man that is left behind on a mission to Mars.I haven\'t read much science fiction and have wanted to explore the genre more. I had heard superb reviews and praise for The Martian and found out it was being turned into a movie so I had to pick it up and see what it was all about. I was completely blown out of the water by this book. I do not think I can express my feelings and thoughts about this book without raving, fangirling and rambling, so bare with me.Weir\'s writing did so many things and his writing style was unique and worked so well in creating a story that sucked me in completely and made me feel like I was one of those people sitting at home glued to the television and keeping up with "Watney Watch" The book is written in journal entries from the main character Mark Watney who was left behind and now trying to survive all on his own on Mars. Watney has such a smart-ass humor that makes you forget at times that he might die at any moment. He is a kickass scientist and his ability to problem solve and survive situations that I would definitely never make it through, is absolutely amazing. There are emotions that come through while reading his entries and you begin to realize that he is doing this to try and maintain his sanity.Weir incorporates a lot of science (chemistry, physics etc) into the story (I mean it is a science fiction novel), but it is done is such a fantastic way that I actually understood what was going on. (I am not scientifically inclined at all). Everything is explained and it helps you realize how long Watney has to survive or how important a certain thing is to his survival. Of course we also get some of the story from the crew members that left Watney behind and people from NASA back home. I thought that this added information and perspective really rounded out the story. It added to the suspense and created a situation much like that of Apollo 11 (have you ever seen the movie? This book has that kind of feel). Although Watney was the main character and one I extremely enjoyed, especially with his smart-ass attitude, I enjoyed the other characters and the development that happened with them.Overall, I do not know if I could recommend this enough. I believe everyone could find aspects of this book they enjoy and it could appeal to all ages. At its core it is a Mars survival story, but it explores the human psyche, the coming together of the human race, sacrifice and the scientific field.'
p3126
aS"This is a brilliant idea and after a slow start, Mark's daily struggles to survive and his ingenuity are kind of interesting. But after a while it's like a guy adrift at sea who passes the time writing instruction manuals.  No doubt the facts are unassailably accurate and there may be an agenda to show how exciting science and math really are.  Honestly?  If math was fun, we wouldn't have a shortage of engineers.On the other hand, what an incredible movie this will make!  Why?  Because there won't be time to explain the concepts in depth; stuff will just happen."
p3127
aS"One of the best books I've read. He has some good science and physics in there that makes everything more plausible. I couldn't put the book down at all."
p3128
aS'Andy Weir must be the luckiest man on earth to be getting this much attention for such a poorly-written book. Imagine an astronaut/botanist/mechanical engineer who is injured and left for dead on Mars. He knows full well that he has to somehow survive for 4 years until he might be rescued. Sounds appealing right? Now imagine him writing the following in his daily logs:"As I crested the rise, I saw something that made me very happy and something that made me very sad: The Hab was intact (yay!) and the MAV was gone (boo!)""My @%%hole is doing as much to keep me alive as my brain." (in reference to using his excrement as manure)"Hell yeah I\'m a botanist! Fear my botany powers!"All of that and more equally awful but similar sentences can be found in the first 20 pages alone. I knew as soon as I read the word "yay!" that I had wasted nearly $10. Thankfully, I won\'t be wasting anymore of my time reading this sophomoric nonsense.'
p3129
aS'Good read'
p3130
aS"Ome of the best SF stories I've read in quite some time.  Great story, great characters and well edited too.  I could hear Mark Whatney's voice as I read the story.  Plus some fantastic humor sprinked in.  Please write more Mr. Weir, you have real talent.  I will pay full list for your stories."
p3131
aS'Fast pace.  Great story telling.  Original hard sci-fi.  Trapped on Mars and trying to beat the odds to get home.  I read this one straight through.'
p3132
aS"I wanted to like this book as there is the potential of a good story here, however the author sacrifices the story to cumbersome and excessive details that are as much fun to read as assembly instructions for a child's playground set; every nut and bolt gets documented over and over. But unlike the playground set, the story would hold up far better with fewer nuts and bolts. Yes, the author did his research thoroughly, unfortunately he let the research take over and bog down the story line. As a result, the characters suffer from lack of development. Mark Watney is the same guy from the first page to the last, his ordeal doesn't change him, we never see him sweat emotionally.The NASA crew back home and aboard the Hermes are stock characters whose relationship to Watney is allowed to stagnate. There are areas throughout that beg for development, such as the world's collective response to one of the greatest rescue missions in history and Watney's relationship to his family at home. None of which ever gets off the ground and reads like just another day at the office. The overall tone is flat and is a disservice to the reader and story.This should be an epic story that speaks to how an individual's struggle to survive can represent mankind's humanity, instead it concerns itself more with how to turn oxygen into rocket fuel, leaving the reader wondering who the real Mark Watney is other than a resourceful botanist stuck alone on Mars. I expect Matt Damon's treatment of the script will remove much of the author's overburdened technical narrative and restore the human element that is missing from the story. This is one novel where I'd prefer the movie doesn't stay completely true to the book."
p3133
aS"His story is amazing, as an aspiring astronaut, it propells my desire to learn more and increase my skills to the level of fiction astronaut Mark Watney. He has a golden sense of humor. I'm not even done with it yet, I got about a hundred plus more pages, but I'll finish in the morning. The story just pulls you in."
p3134
aS'This was a very slow read. It seemed to go on forever with technical terms of how he survived and such. I kept waiting for him to find Martians  but all he did was whimper all the time about how he had to stay alive.'
p3135
aS'i love this book!'
p3136
aS'A book that keeps you up at night to finish.'
p3137
aS"This book is really good.  It's written in an interesting style of journal entries and the main character is very likeable.  The problem solving that he goes through does require a bit of suspended reality.  This would be a good book for husband and wife to read together our for a mixed gender book club."
p3138
aS'Great for a math student'
p3139
aS'Great read, love this character . Mark is my kind of nerd'
p3140
aS'This book was unexpectedly amazing.  The narration was intelligent and plausible.  I actually felt that I needed to wikipedia the Mars project and learn about the main character due to the reality of the story.  I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in space travel and science fiction genre novels.  I do not consider myself to be a sci-fi fanatic and was hesitant in reading a book about one person alone on a planet, but this is by far my favorite book of all time!'
p3141
aS"Filled with great tension and humor The Martian is a fast read. Sometimes very technical, but punctuated with humor and action. Can't wait to see the movie now."
p3142
aS'Too detailed'
p3143
aS"Couldn't put it down!"
p3144
aS'I really enjoyed the book. The attention to detail and solutions to the problems encountered really pointed out the research done for this book. Nice job,!'
p3145
aS'A must read, before you see the movie or after!'
p3146
aS'Fresh, fascinating, and FUNNY!The narrator has a great sense of humor, which believe it or not only makes this suspenseful survivor story even more amazing. Also, HIS SCIENCE IS STRONG. Prepare to learn a heck of a lot while reading through this gem of a story.Every now and again it lags a bit when it gets into the nitty gritty of some points, like potato calories, but not too much.I definitely recommend this book to science lovers, space lovers, and readers who enjoy laughing.'
p3147
aS'I liked it a lot. Good science, which is nice in a book.Despite that, a good story with good characters.Many times it seems like you get one or the other.Very nice to have both.'
p3148
aS"The beginning of this book was so banal and displayed such an impoverished vocabulary--how many times can you use the f-word because you really can't say that your hero is terrified--or you don't know how to explain human emotion except by overworked clich\xc3\xa9s?  Let me explain the Ares program??? Are readers that science challenged that a more intelligent one wouldn't suffice?Just another boring sci-fi with a hero more worried about--what? his masculinity?--than the fact that what is supposedly doing really is remarkable, terrifying but wondrous.Don't bother."
p3149
aS"Corny, juvenile, uninteresting, boring characters, just not a good read.  I don't usually take the time to review books but this warranted a response.  Waste of my time."
p3150
aS'I have read everything by Asimov, Heinlein. This book reminds me of their entertaining and fascinating skill at storytelling. Thank you for writing this excellent yarn. Loved it.'

p3152
aS"This book was really awesome. I was so hooked I read the entire thing in a single day, couldn't get enough. Can't wait until he releases another book."
p3153
aS'Loved it'
p3154
aS"Once I started reading, I was hooked. A story of an astronaut's struggle for survival after being mistakenly abandoned on Mars. It is a story told with humor and great suspense as he is faced with problem after problem and must improvise solution after solution or die!This book is a rare treat.Why only four stars . . . Because I finished it at two in the morning and I'm going to be Sooooo tired tomorrow."
p3155
aS"I couldn't put this down. There aren't any major flaws I can think of minutes after finishing. It made me excited, then sad, then angry, then excited again. I cannot recommend this more than I do now."
p3156
aS'I started this book many weeks ago.  Within just a few pages I lost interest.  It is sophomoric and terribly tedious, certainly far from compelling. I stopped reading.  Then I read great reviews in the media.  Lots of buzz!  A movie was to be made!  What was wrong with me, a reader of countless science and science fiction books?  So I tried again.  Maybe I just wasn\'t in the mood to read a book like this the first time.  Well, this time around I found, again, that it was sophomoric, tedious and not at all compelling.  I made it through less than before.An author, whose name I can\'t recall, once said a reader shouldn\'t feel guilty stopping reading a book if it doesn\'t strike them.  Otherwise a reader is wasting precious time for reading other books.  Good advice as to this book for sure.Believe it or not, the premise makes me eager to see the Ridley Scott movie version.  Most times a movie version of a book is a paltry substitute.  This time my guess is the movie will be far better than the book.I see that people who buy this book sometimes also buy "In the Heart of the Sea" by Nathaniel Philbrick.  For a true edge of the seat survival story just buy that one.  And it\'s non-fiction!'
p3157
aS"This book was super lame. It was like reading about an annoyingly optimistic guy apparently without any feelings whatsoever, no soul and no sense of humor work on his truck for 10 hours. You can tell an engineer or accountant wrote this. Crazy the attention it's getting.  I can't believe how bad it was."
p3158
aS'fun and suspenseful read to the last page.'
p3159
aS"foul language alert! would be much better if the F bomb was left out! funny how authors  screen writers say they want to be 'realistic' by having characters swear etc, - as if you aren't already suspending belief like crazy in order to enter their fictional world!Otherwise a gripping tale of survival against huge odds, using creativity training and guts."
p3160
aS"It is a great story and a great book. However, there was no need for the tough language used in the book. People of that class and education do not swear like they did in the book. The book would've been much better without it. Consequently, I cannot recommend this Book because of the language."
p3161
aS'Amazing!!'
p3162
aS'Surviving alone on Mars is easy.  Read "A Captain\'s Duty" -- the story of Captain Philips -- for a guy who meets and surmounts real dangers. Even if you have seen the movie.'
p3163
aS'If you love engineering and science and like to imagine "what if"scenarios, then you will love this other worldly survival story.'
p3164
aS'a little pedantic'
p3165
aS'I loved the engineering  science bent. The main character has a great sense of humor.'
p3166
aS'I really liked this book.  Very well written and kept my interest.'
p3167
aS'Excellent book. Enjoyed it from start to finish.'
p3168
aS'This is quite simply the best "hard-science" science fiction book I have read in a long, LONG time. It is PACKED with technical details and realistic problems to be solved. It is the Apollo 13 mission on steroids, and easily worth twice the $9.99 I paid for it.I understand that some people may not like all the technical detail, but you don\'t have to fully understand it to appreciate what Mr. Weir has created here. This is an intense work with a new (and realistic) life-threatening peril on every other page.If you have ANY appreciation for REAL science fiction (as opposed to sword-and-sorcery fantasy), you should buy this book immediately!'
p3169
aS'absolutely fantastic book, read it cover to cover and loved every moment.  hope the movie is just as good!'
p3170
aS'Um......can\'t understand all the love here. It\'s just badly written, no world-building (doesnt really have to take place on Mars at all!) it\'s all exposition dialogue (it\'s already a hollywood script) and the characters are unbelievable (they remind me of the crew of Prometheus. Our main character is basically Mel Gibson from Lethal Weapon. The german astronaut says things like "Well-played?" The director of Mars flight has never been at work at 9pm before?) And the old "disco sucks" trope is a running joke? What is this crap? Anyone who gave this a good review I have a hard time believing has ever read SF before...or any other book.'
p3171
aS'Easy reading and good internal dialog. I laughed out loud several times while reading this. The science was good as well as the drama of the situations throughout the story. Very believable as something that could happen. JPL should take note on their mission planning...'
p3172
aS'Did not like this book at all, after reading 15% of the book wanted to go to end of book just to see if he made it.  Too verbose, too tiring of his projects, only finished it as it was a book club selection.  Ugh!'
p3173
aS"Can't een describe how great this was/is.  Best read of the last ten years."
p3174
aS'Entertaining, somewhat predictable in "what can go wrong", but still a great and fun read.  Appreciated that A. Weir manages to mix a novel with scientific tech talk, in a way that adds the "possibility" of events in a real future.  Highly recommend it.'
p3175
aS'Liked the book, but keep thinking:  "this could be so much better".  I understand the point was the make the reader feel the isolation, but felt to well done at times.  Keep thinking I would like to see the reactions and story line on earth and Hermes.Also would have like more after the climax of the story.  Books just stops.Good weekend read.'
p3176
aS'Truly believable and a delightful read.  I\'m a former NASA Mission Controller and could identify completely with all the dilemmas, triumphs and bureaucratic traps described as well as the science.  The hero is shown as a "geek with personality" who keeps you entertained while learning the possibilities of human ingenuity when faced with life or death options at every turn.  I have recommended this book to all my friends telling them to plan their time well because it was almost impossible to put down.'
p3177
aS'Very detailed ( similar to a Clancy novel) but very entertaining as you just know something else is going to "happen" to threaten survival in an unforgiving place.'
p3178
aS'I really enjoyed this book. It was interesting and suspenseful. I would recommend it.'
p3179
aS'Superb tale, tense at times mixed with joy and humor. Science in a delightful form.'
p3180
aS'long tedious read with tons of details but no compelling storyline and disappointing ending'
p3181
aS"I won't take the time to write a proper review here and I don't usually post what I think of books I buy on my kindle. But I just want to say as a warning to people, this book is god awful. I mean it IS the worst Sci Fi book I have ever read and I say that without any hesitation. The author is a complete novice and his only skill is in writing extensive and boring details about imaginary equipment that has been brought along on this mission to mars. There are no remarkable characters in the book, and the characters are all brutally uninteresting. The main character barely seemed to even notice that he was stranded for years on another planet. It's also hard to believe he is even an astronaut, considering how juvenile his dialogue is. Do you imagine one of the few people chosen for a mission to mars saying things like (yay!) or booyah! and other such cancerous things? Well, I don't. I'm tossing this one back in the trash where it belongs."
p3182
aS'An excellent book from beginning to end. This book starts out with a stark outlook for Mark Watney as he faces the challenges of surviving on Mars by himself. Reading as Mark solves science and engineering problems brought out my inner engineer.Many thanks to the author Andy Weir for this awesome book.'
p3183
aS"I had expected that the premise of a stranded character without any direct interaction with other characters would make the story feel tedious, but this was not the case at all. Instead, it kept a great pace the whole way through. I particularly appreciated the accurate science, which was well done, but not overwhelming for the reader. I'm an engineer, and my spouse is an artist with an aversion to math, but we both found that the technical detail was done just right."
p3184
aS'Great book!  A fictional page turner that reads like the Apollo 13 story with a man versus the elements survival theme.'
p3185
aS'Enjoyable story line.  Lots of science.'
p3186
aS'A breath taking novel that made problem solving, lateral thinking and science fascinating. Character development was weak which is why I did not give it a 5'
p3187
aS"Great story!  I read the first half of the book right before seeing the movie, and the second half right after seeing it.  I loved both, but the book is better.  Andy Weir is a natural story teller.  Mark Watney is likeable and funny.  The story is suspenseful and fascinating.  Read this book.  You won't regret it!"
p3188
aS"One of the best stories I've ever read. This isn't a normal scienc-fiction book, it assumes the reader is engrossed enough to figure out some of its technical bits for themselves."
p3189
aS'Enjoyable read - pace was good and the level of technical approach was at the right level to be understood without being overwhelming.'
p3190
aS'Real good! Fast delivery as well.'
p3191
aS"Love the Martian !  I bought three of these and had the author sign it (look it up on reddit- you can mail it to him with a return stamp and he'll sign it).  It's funny and great especially for middle school kids.  It has some swear words but nothing too bad. It's an easy read."
p3192
aS"This book scores perfectly on the factor I consider most important in my reading:  a protagonist I care about.  I'm no science buff, and a lot of the science in this book I more or less skipped over.  Didn't matter.  What I cared about was Mark and his never-give-up personality.  He is a delightful character who is a bit like the Energizer Bunny--he goes on and on and on, when just about everyone else thinks the curtain is about to come down.  Took the book to my mom who is almost 92.  She loves it as well.  Mr. Weir, you did a good job.  A very good job.  And I cannot help but think you must be quite a bit like Mark.  Good for you."
p3193
aS'This was incredible. Could not put it down, on the metaphorical edge of my Seattle while time. Amazing book. Highly recommend!'
p3194
aS"Couldn't put it down - a fantastic read."
p3195
aS"Very rarely, actually never do I read for 6 straight hours without a break until 3 am. I did with this book. I haven't been this gripped by a book in a very long time. I thought it was fantastic. Not to difficult of a read, either. Highly recommended no matter which genre you typically stick with."
p3196
aS'Great book... nice fast read.'
p3197
aS"It's good."
p3198
aS"Interesting, unusual and a good primer on real hard issues facing our future efforts to visit and colonize Mars.  I enjoyed this book at the recommendation of my son; we share a taste for SF probably inflicted on him by myself when he was too young to know better.  This is worth the read, but you had better be able to enjoy the Macguiver nature of this man lone battle.  The science and technology implicit in the book, kind of a Robinson Crusoe on Mars, provide both the drama, such as it is, and the only part of the novel that keeps you in it.  What's lacking here is any ability to draw characters, motivation, and physchology into the plot, a never-relenting compendium of screwups and science fixes as the hero struggles to keep himself alive.  None of the characters are deeply drawn.  What's missing is any sense of our hero's feelings and characteer as he struggles.  Nor are the ins and outs of NASA, admittedly one of the worst beaurocracies extant, drawn in any convincing way.  All the characters are pretty much the same, no real politics-lifeblood of Washington-or sense of the emotional impacts of thie survivor's life.  You'll like it if you like science fairs; you'll hate it if you like CJ Cherryh.  I applaud the effort to impose science into Science Fiction; in general i wish there were more, but in the end it's unsatisfying.  I gave it four more for effort that for sucess."
p3199
aS'Very interesting science but it got in the way of the narrative'
p3200
aS'This was a quick read and quite enjoyable. I loved the main character and really enjoyed rooting for him!'
p3201
aS"The Martian has all the elements of what could be a great book but it never quite takes flight. Overall I found it to be repetitive and one-dimensional. Also a majority of the text is dense math and science related jargon which I found myself skipping over for the most part. I can see how this would be an added bonus for some but for the majority of readers these sections might as well be in Chinese.Here's basically how the entire book plays out.-Oh no, he's going to die-He fixed it!-Oh no, it broke. He's going to die again!-He fixed it!-Oh no, it broke. He's going to die again!-He fixed it!Repeat x20, the end."
p3202
aS"Was a little skeptical at first because I'm not a fan of first person writing style, but Mark is alone on Mars so it makes total sense. Well thought out adventure story. Totally engrossed in the story."
p3203
aS'Loved it. Great characters, great story, not dependent on some stupid piece of unrealistic technology to keep the story going.'
p3204
aS'I did not want this book to end... That is how much I loved it.  A must read!!'
p3205
aS"An interesting thought experiment, combining Robinson Crusoe's toils, Heinlein's flat, though likable, heroic characters, and Baron Munchausen's fast thinking. I liked it because it's so wonderfully nerdy and yet cool at the same time. Also the book being on its own a result of blog-posts evolving with time is unique."
p3206
aS'If you are looking at this then you know about this book.The premise is simple, how would a highly resourceful and well trained astronaut manage if accidentally left for dead by his colleagues during an emergency evacuation of the surface of Mars?Mr Weir takes us through a taut, irreverent, hilarious and suspenseful ride.This one hits all the right marks. I want my son to be old enough to read this book.A must read for all who love science fiction, human resourcefulness and comedies.'
p3207
aS'I purchased this book based on the reviews.  I am a streaky reader.  I\'ll read a bunch of Sci-Fi and then move to historical drama and then to Biographies and then to baseball.  I\'ve read and loved all of the Wool series and am eagerly awaiting Third Shift.  This book jumped out at me and I bought it figuring it would be a nice little read until something jumped out at me.  I had just finished Pillars of the Earth and needed a break so I jumped into my Sci-Fi mode.  This book was not a nice little break, it was a tremendous read and now I\'ve added Mr. Weir to my must read list.I was believing that the author must have been an astronaut prior to becoming an author with the detail he put behind the technology and strategies of a Mars landing, life on Mars, the return trip and all of the trials and tribulations that the main character faces in his time alone on Mars.  This may scare some people away, but don\'t the detail is what is needed.  He vividly describes the problem, why it happened and then steers the character through a very viable and believable solution.  An average author could not have pulled this book off to the degree that Mr. Weir did.The bouncing around between the daily (SOL) log book and the characters on Earth who are working out solutions to help bring the main character back home are done very smoothly.  The prospect of reading a log book gave me reservation.  The entries in the log book were thorough, filled with sarcasm, humor and spirit.  It would exactly be how I would have approached entries in my log book had I been stranded on Mars.  With no one to talk with, the absurdity of my situation and in the remote hopes that someone would actually read this log book someday, you wouldn\'t pull any punches.A strong 5 star rating for this book.  For those of you who complain about grammar, spelling or punctuation errors in an e-book, get over it.  Look past these issues and appreciate the genius of this writer and be thankful that at $0.99, you can read high quality material such as, "The Martian"I\'ll be reading more Mr. Weir.  Keep up the great work!'
p3208
aS"This was a great read.  Too bad I bought the Kindle version instead of the book.  I'd love to pass it on to others."
p3209
aS'I don\'t ever really review here, but man oh man was this book just awful. Am I supposed to believe that this astronaut wrote this first-person when he acts, sounds, behaves mostly like a 13-year-old boy? "Yay! Boo! Let\'s make a bad gay joke." Ugh. Total nightmare. I couldn\'t wait for it to be over. I actually wanted the main character to die so that the book would just end, but no, he had to strive on and on and on. Yay!'
p3210
aS'Might have been a good book if the bad language was left out, Did not finish the first chapter,'
p3211
aS'Pretty mediocre. Plot was okay, characters were awful. Dialogue was awful. Scene description was awful. Zero depth to anything in this book. If you want to be entertained by poopy language and imaginary science for 300 pages, this book is for you.'
p3212
aS'Exciting, moves along a nice pace, easy read, very thoughtfully done and holds interest well, especially if you have a scientific bent.'
p3213
aS'This book is great. Great! I was with Mark Watney all the way, and got angry every time something went wrong. At one point, I found myself saying, "Can\'t this guy catch a break?! Geez!" My only complaint is that I wanted more at the end.I would recommend this book to anyone.'
p3214
aS'Great read. Was a little nervous about technical talk before I started the book but the human story far outweighed what technical descriptions were needed to pull the story together.'
p3215
aS'As a long time sci fi reader I have taken in Heinlien, Clarke and Asimovs beds (and worst).  This easily stands with their very top stories. One book I could put down that comes close to this is George Stewart\'s "Earth Abides"  Another survival sci fi, it captured my imagination, kept me reading and I\'ve never forgotten it. That is what this book will be for me but so much more. I flew jets in the Navy, landing on a carrier at night, had a couple of exciting emergencies. That was the feeling this, book gave me. Along with that, I have always wanted to be an astronaut. I once drew a headstone for my future grave proclaiming to be the first man to Mars. I worked in DDMS -the militaries support staff to NASA for space flight. We were there to help in the event of an extraordinary event (big problem, aborted shuttle that paraphrases, bailout of the shuttle crew -yep they can now after Challenger, etc).  This book is so authentic to what I saw and did during that tour, I was giddy at the realism. Great job writing a suspenseful, realistic and epic novel!'
p3216
aS'Hard to put down. Suspenseful yet times of utter relief that someone could survive one catastrophe after another. Glad I read the book before seeing the movie.'
p3217
aS'Too technical. It seemed to me more a manual for technically inclined people than a novel.'
p3218
aS'What a hidden gem!  This book was one of my favorites I have read in a long time.  I could not recommend it more!'
p3219
aS'I haven\'t been reading as much science fiction as I used to.  Mainly because the current trend in this genre has tended to be dystopian and disheartening.  I miss the golden age of science fiction that showed how the future could be more uplifting and that technology is not the enemy, but our friend.  I found this old style spirit in "The Martian".It is the story of a young engineer and astronaut that is accidentally left for dead on Mars.  He is forced to use his wits and a "can do" attitude to survive on the red planet alone, but to do what he can to allow for his rescue once NASA figures out he is still alive!  As I read about this man facing the hostile environment of Mars and using technology that is present today to beat the odds, I was mesmerized.  In the end, I was rooting for him as I might for the home team at the local football game.This is an excellent science fiction novel and it is my hope that it starts a new trend, one of science fiction that is based on real science and presents a story about a hopeful future.'
p3220
aS'Great read, great fun.  Technically correct.  Adventure story of survival. Can do attitude.'
p3221
aS'This is the kind of science-based nuts-and-bolts sci-fi I loved as a pre-teen and teenager in the fifties. But the author has done a better job of making his characters believable than most of those stories ever did. The occasional profanity sounds "real" by today\'s standards, but somehow many great writers of the past managed to tell a pretty good story without it. Result: I can\'t yet recommend this to my younger grandkids, who would enjoy everything else about the book.'
p3222
aS'Good story,  science is nearly spot on, great  "human condition " story.'
p3223
aS'What a great read. The book will restore your faith in science fiction, science, and humanity. Highly entertaining. A real page turner.'
p3224
aS'The author starts with 2 F-bombs on the first page. It is so distracting to me when an author is unable to deliver their concept without foul language that it is almost impossible, for me, to suspend my sense of disbelief. I tried to forge ahead a few pages but I could tell the poor language choices were going to be a pattern throughout the book and I gave it up.So if you are fan of crude language then this may be a good novel, but if you find it offensive and a signal that the author has not developed the skills to deliver the story without it, then avoid at any price.'
p3225
aS'As you read "The Martian" you can almost hear the pitch for the coming movie: "Gravity meets Robinson Crusoe meets Cast Away". Tailor-made for two-hour film, it\'s adequately written, veering between first person and third person (with a tiny bit of omniscient thrown in) narration. A time-killer and nothing more.'
p3226
aS'great story with real science in it'
p3227
aS'Great story, it never got old. I loved the way the science was true to life, or seemed to be (I did not actually check any of his calculations). Toward the end it was downright riveting !!'
p3228
aS'An amazing book, non stop action. Compassion and humanity at its best. A triumph of human resilience and ingenuity.'
p3229
aS'Really a great book! Although wary at first that it would be one more castaway story, not so. It really pulls you in, making you care for the hero.'

aS"I usually pass on the space science fiction works but this one is exceptional.  Andy Weir has created a believable, intense and sometimes funny techno-thriller that is simply a must read.  I defy you to read the first 3 or 4 pages and then set this book aside.  You can't!  Andy, this was an  outstanding reading experience; can't wait to read more of your works."
p3231
aS"So the science was very, very deep in this book.  Way over my head.  But it was a darned good story of survival that I couldn't put it down.  I admit it...I sort of sped my way through some of the more technical passages, but I got enough to reinforce my profound respect for the science minded of this world while enjoying a darned good story!"
p3232
aS'The best opening line I have read in a book in a long time! This book was so mesmerizing and believable that I had to keep reminding myself that there never has been a person sent to Mars. The research conducted  by the author was extensive and it clearly showed in the story. I loved the humor and the science which made this a great read for me.'
p3233
aS"Like Castaway (Tom Hanks) with a sarcastic sense of humor and a lot more action. Can't wait to see the movie"
p3234
aS'Unfortunately The Martian feels as if though it was written by a teenager and is completely overrated.  Why does this book has so many 5 star reviews? I got halfway through and forced myself to finish reading it since I had already invested time in it.'
p3235
aS'Very enjoyable read'
p3236
aS"I had my doubts but ultimately I really liked this novel. It is by far the most geeky, technical novel I've ever read. He focuses a great deal on the specifics of how he might bend available technology to meet his new needs. Somehow while that sounds totally boring, it is all part of a compelling story. Clearly this book spoke to the technical geeky side of my own personality while at the same time being very nicely done fiction."
p3237
aS'Great book and opening line...'
p3238
aS'It is Apollo 13 for the Mars era.  Great read.'
p3239
aS"I downloaded the e-book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The e-book was put together very well. The Author Andy Weir did a good job writing this e-book. This e-book is very well written with good smart characters. The scenes described in the story really took me there. I defiantly got caught up in the story. This is the first e-book in a long time that I didn't want to put down. This e-book is special. The struggle for survival is so unique and different. There are so many different feelings that come out of this story, hope solitude, friendship, survival, loneliness, exploration, bravery, I could keep going on here but you should have gotten the point by now.  Furrowed his brow was over used. I could have done with out the swearing. I have and would recommend this book to a friend."
p3240
aS"In Andy Weir's THE MARTIAN, an astronaut gets left for dead on the planet Mars, and that's just in the first few pages!  This science fiction adventure offers up something different -- a smart, wise cracking, and HUMAN main character who is challenged by obstacle after obstacle. (Obviously, a LOT of research went into the scientific aspects of the novel because the solutions to problems were credible and scientifically sound.)  I highly recommend the novel and am looking forward to the release of the movie..."

aS"For Me it was very much like listening to someone read the phone book.  I'm sure it's me and not the book."
p3242
aS"I was pleasantly surprised as I don't normally gravitate to science fiction novels.  However, after seeing all the excellent reviews, reading the history of how this book landed on the best seller list, and now a motion picture with Matt Damon (who usually picks excellent projects), I thought I would see what all the hoopla was about. Add to the mix, Amazon offered a decent price for the Kindle download so I felt that all the stars were aligned to join those who already felt this was a must read.The author, Andy Weir, does provide a good deal of science terminology and space technology that can be mind numbing in these types of books. However, he displays a much appreciated knack of not going too far so that those of us neophytes not into the labyrinthine world of science/space terminology and applications can at least gather enough from his information to get the gist of what the main character is doing while trying to figure out how to survive and hopefully be rescued from Mars, and still not have your eyes glaze over in the process!  It is a fantastic story, excellently crafted, and hard to put down as it certainly is a nail biter and white knuckler!I recommend this to everyone I know who enjoys reading an exciting, interesting and well written book because I know, just like me, some folks tend to steer away from this genre.  Don't avoid this one, it is well worth the read and the ride!"
p3243
aS"The Martian is a well thought out and executed book, the main character is instantly likeable and you will be cheering for him to beat the odds right from the start. The problem solving and humorous approach to constantly life threatening challenges was engrossing and entertaining. The science and engineering issues are really interesting and get you thinking about how you might tackle it, the author is clearly well versed in the complexities of surviving in a hostile world. Great and fun read even for those who don't consider themselves science geeks, very highly recommended!"
p3244
aS'This by far the best book I have read in a long time.  Well done, stimulating, emotional. Great book.'
p3245
aS"Sorry. I don't think I could stand this guy if I ever met him, so I don't want to spend 6 hours of my life reading about him. I love SF, but I can't get past the character for the probably good story. Deleted off my Kindle."
p3246
aS"The book is a delight. A well told story that is also a peek into the rise of complex, rich, full of twists and turns unfoldment of ultimately 'simple' fundamental conditions. Not to mention how likable and involving the characters are.There is a lot of 'class' to this story, and a nod to the great Sci-fi writers. This is definitely a remarkable book, even if at face value it seems like something you or your parents may have read at the golden age of Sci-fi. and that is meant in a most positive sense here!"
