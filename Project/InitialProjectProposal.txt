Project Proposal:

Problem Statement:
Clustering of raw "20 Newsgroups" dataset and labelling the clusters using Wikipedia by PMI scores.

Suprevised or unsuprevised:
It is an unsupervised learning Alogrithm

The Dataset:
As mentioned above we would be using "20 Newsgroups" dataset available at http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

Instance in the Data:
Each data point is a document.First few lines from a sample Document:
From: sd345@city.ac.uk (Michael Collier)
Subject: Converting images to HP LaserJet III?
Nntp-Posting-Host: hampton
Organization: The City University

Attributes of Interest:
As is the norm with text data, we can use Bag-of-words representaion for the documents, where each word is a feature.
The value of the feature can be one of the following:
1. number times the wor appears in the document
2. a better feature would be the frequency with which the word appears in a particular document.
3. tfidf
4. n-grams
